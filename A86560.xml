            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Councel of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> not to believe
every ſpirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God. And ſure
there is now as much need of this counſel as ever, becauſe there are
diverſity of Spirits and Prophets gone out into the world, and all pretend to
God; but all confeſs not (that is, magnifie not, or lead not to exalt)
Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh; but divers of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or undervalue
that; by which it is manifeſt that they are not of God to thoſe that duly
try them, but that they are of that ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, of which we have
heard, that it ſhould come into the world: And truly, though it be an heavy
judgement of God to order ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <pb facs="tcp:152283:3"/>of error to enter
into, and amongſt men, and men to be poſſeſſed and acted by him; yet
if the matter be well and duly conſidered, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a juſt and
righteous judgement, and may afford us much matter of warning: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hath, or could God have teſtified or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love more to the world,
then in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth his only begotten Son to be believed on; and to that end
to be delivered to death for our offences, and become the propitiation for our
ſins, and being raiſed again and glorified to hold forth in and through him
unto us an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable fulneſs of glory and ſalvation? And what might
God look for, and challenge at our hands for ſo great goodneſs, leſs then
all poſſible thankfulneſs, and moſt chearful ready receit of, and
ſubmiſſion to him? but alas, how contrary are the returns that he findeth
from men? What is there that is ſo little regarded, and ſo much neglected
as this his Son? what ſo little received and fed upon by men? Is not the
preaching of the Croſs of Chriſt become foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs, again, not onely

Reſurrection for them, as ſometimes the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Manna
with joy and admiration, have with them alſo after a while grown weary
thereof, as if it was a light bread: and their ſouls have loathed him, and
luſted after ſome other thing to feed upon, that might more puff them up in
themſelves, and give more ſenſual ſatisfaction. And alas, how few are
there who are not more or leſs tainted with this infection, as if there was
not an enoughneſs in Chriſt, &amp; his Death, Sacrifice, and Mediation for
them to feed upon: Now what more juſt with God, then that his ſo great love
being ſo abrogated, and ſo nothing ſet by, ſhould turn to jealouſie,
and that he revenge the injury done unto his Son, and to himſelf with the
heat of indignation, by ſending to them (as to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for
their offence, fiery Serpents, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.) ſpirits of error, and of
deluſion; that becauſe they received not the love of the Truth that they
might be ſaved, but had pleaſure in their unrighteouſneſs, in
diſeſteeming ſo great a witneſs of love, and not in the truth;
therefore the efficacie of error ſhould infatuate them, and carry them
headlong into deſtruction; the abuſe and contempt of greateſt love
deſerving to be revenged with the ſevereſt condemnation: But alas, where
the ſpirit of Error hath gotten root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <pb facs="tcp:152283:4"/>how many are there ſo
ſtrongly giddified therewith, that they make but a mock of theſe things,
and think there is no other hell but what here befals them; throwing up the
whole Chriſtian Faith by the very foundation! A pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and much to be
bewailed miſchief, which cals for not onely our beſt endeavours, by
Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications, and faithful Inſtruction to prevent its
ſpreading; but might alſo chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in many the Magiſtrates
inſpection; that as of late they have worthily made an Act to prevent and
puniſh Blaſphemy againſt God, ſo they might endeavour to ſtop the
over-free ſpreading of Blaſphemy againſt Chriſt by the like
proviſion. But for that, its our buſineſs to pray God rightly to direct
them, and that none of them that ſhould diſcountenance ſuch evil, be
either tainted therewith themſelves, or ſo far deſtitute of that
ſpiritual Eye-ſalve, as not to have thereof a right diſcerning.</p>
            <p>As for your parts, Worthy Friends, I hope you have received ſo
much of that holy Unction as hath helped you to underſtand the wiles of
Satan; ſo that I may ſay to you, as the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.21.
<hi>I write not to you becauſe ye know not the Truth, but becauſe ye know
it, and that no lie is of the Truth;</hi> both bleſſing God that he doth
keep you in ſo evil a day; and praying for you, that yet ye may be filled
with the Spirit of <pb facs="tcp:152283:4"/>Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and ſo more
abundantly anointed with that ſpiritual Eye-ſalve, that ye may be further
able to diſcern things that differ, and ſo be kept for even. And indeed I
know no better thing that I can wiſh for you then that; for where that is
not, I know not what elſe can preſerve men: For Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in his
own colours, but diſguiſed as an Angel of Light, not as an enemy but (as of
old the Serpent) as a friend that will ſhew the way to a more happy and
glorious condition, its an eaſie thing to be circumvented by him; ſuch high
expreſſions, ſuch glorious ſpeeches, ſuch enticing and ſwelling
words (though full of vanity to a ſpiritual diſcerning) becauſe they have
not the bread of Life, the foundation of our hope in them, with whom are they
not taking?</p>
            <p>The conſideration of which having preſſed me forward to the
writing and publiſhing of this ſmall Treatiſe (in which though I be but
weak, I have endeavoured according as by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant I am bound for the rooting
out of Error and hereſie in my place and calling (though not primely upon
that conſideration) to prevent the ſpreading of this grand infection; that
though I have little hopes of reducing thoſe that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, yet I might
be a means to ſtabliſh ſome that are wavering and prevent their falling)
I have choſen, as to the Saints in general, ſo to you <pb facs="tcp:152283:5"/>in
particular, to Dedicate and preſent it, out of that reſpect I bear to you;
and the good thats in you, and ſenſe of obligation upon me toward you.

            <p>YOu cannot but know that the Church of God is in Scripture
reſembled to a natural body, wherein are many members united to each other,
and to one head, and by one Spirit growing up in exact unity; now as in the
natural body there may be many infirmities, and many things are liable to
offend and hurt it, ſo alſo is it in this myſtical: ſometimes it may be
ſubject to diſtempers by nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, crude, undigeſted humours the want
of thorow cloſing with, and drinking in divine truths, or the drinking in
untruths, may occaſion a ſurfeit, and averſation from truth; ſometimes
flatuous and windy humours of pride, high-mindedneſs, and lying ſpirits
getting into ſome of its members, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper it; ſometimes
feavouriſh heats of violent headineſs inſtead of wel-tempered zeal for
God and godlineſs may inflame it; and ſometimes the cold aguiſh, or
palſie humours of deadneſs in, &amp; benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs to Spiritual motions
in its tendency to its <pb facs="tcp:152283:6"/>ſpiritual and ſupream end, may ſo
ſeize upon it, as much to impair its ſtrength, and to appearance bring it
nigh to death; But God, whoſe Temple it is, hath provided for it againſt
ſuch diſtempers and dangers both meat and medicine to feed and cure it: As
Chriſt himſelf is the prime and great tree of life, in whom the word is
ſo united to the humanity, that the humanity was ever in all times of Winter
blaſts, and Sommer droughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and upheld thereby, and made
glorious, fruitful, and his fruits are good and proſperous, fit to feed, and
his Leaves full of vertue to heal the Nations: So is every one that through
grace is brought to believe in Chriſt, and gathered up into unity with
Chriſt, and lives upon the word of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 1.3.</hi> as a tree
planted by the waters ſide. <hi>Jer. 17.7,8.</hi> Even one of thoſe trees
of life that grow upon the banks of that great river of the knowledge of God in
Chriſt, that proceeds from out his ſanctuary, and runs from beſide the
Altar (or ſacrifice of Chriſt) and under the threſhold, (the Goſpel and
its Ordinances holding forth Chriſt) <hi>Ezek. 47.1.2.12.</hi> whoſe fruit
is for meat, and its leaf for medicine: <hi>The lips of the righteous feed
many; and their fruit is as a tree of life,</hi> Prov. <hi>10,21. and
11.30.</hi> the doctrine they receive from Chriſt is <hi>a wholſome
doctrine, 1 Tim. 6 3.4.</hi> and full of healing, by which they are more and
more rooted into, and united with Chriſt, till they all grow up into ſuch a
cloſe and full union <pb facs="tcp:152283:6"/>with him, that the <hi>many trees on the
banks of that river.</hi> Rev. <hi>22.2.</hi> be made perfectly but <hi>one on
both ſides of that river,</hi> Eph. <hi>4.13.</hi> Till we all come in the
unity of the faith, and acknowledgement of the Son of God unto a perfect man.
Now I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in this body there are at preſent (as at other times) not
only many inward weakneſſes, but alſo many things from without
indangering it; yea, that many parts of it are ſorely laid open to infections
from divers that ſeem to be of it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with it; though I be leſs
then the leaſt of all Saints, yet according to the meaſure of the gift of
Chriſt given me, I have endeavoured to adminiſter that that I have from the
head, which may make for its ſtrength and nouriſhment; yea, and to hold
forth ſuch of his Leaves ſupplied to me by his good hand, as may either
prevent or cure the infections feared; deſiring that we may all ſo preſs
after further knowledge of, and growth in Chriſt, as that yet we may be kept
from imbracing falſe Chriſts, and from being ſnared by the poiſon of
thoſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who inſtead of haſtening mens growth up into
Chriſt, which they pretend, do ſecretly and ſubtilely corrupt men from
the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt; as if a man by ſtretching of a twig to
make it grow longer, ſhould pull and ſever it from the body of the tree
upon which it groweth. <hi>As for the mind to be without knowledge is not good;
ſo he that haſteth with his feet ſinneth,</hi> Prov <hi>19.2.</hi> I
deſire that what I preſent to you in love, and for <pb facs="tcp:152283:7"/>your good,
may be taken in good part, and ſoberly conſidered by you, and that what you
ſee to ſuit with, and proceed from that good spirit of God, that is but one
and the ſame in all ages, and gives unity to the body in all its memberly
differences, may be received and held faſt by you; and if in any thing you
ſee either further or better then I, impart of your meaſure alſo to me,
that we may grow up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by that which every joynt ſupplieth, all
hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt, and not letting go the head from whence we receive the right
and true ſpirit that will give us to increaſe: So ſhall our feet abide
within the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Lord himſelf ſhall dwell
amongst us, ſhall judge, rule and teach us, and in his teaching we ſhall
not be <hi>vainly puft up with a carnal mind,</hi> like thoſe bodies that are
puft up with unwholſome humours, but grow <hi>ſolidly fat and well-liking,
and ſhew that he is gratious, and that there is no deceit or
unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> To him, and the word of his grace, which is
able to build you up and give you the inheritance, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, with my

               <head>Sect. 2. Who are Saints.</head>
               <p>A Saint hath his name from Sanctification; Now to ſanctifie is
to ſeparate or ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from common and prophane to holy uſe, from
being a mans own, and for himſelf, to be Gods, and for God, which in reall
Saints is done by God, and according to his Will. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. And God
doth it by his Spirit, and in the <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152283:14"/>Name of his Son, who hath
fore-offered up himſelf to God for men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.11. The Spirit of
God in the Word, or Name of Chriſt preached, or unfoulded to them,
diſcovering the Grace or good will of God towards men, in the Gift, Death and
Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby killing and crucifying them to the
fleſh (all fleſhly birth, parts, wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs,
affections and luſts of their own) and in drawing them to Chriſt to believe
in him and his bloud, and ſo to communicate with his Sacrifice, ſanctifieth
men and makes them Saints or holy unto God; it being the anointed one Chriſt
himſelf that is their ſanctification; by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him they become
ſeparared from the world, and are made Gods lot, part and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a people
holy to him. Saints then are a <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple created in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (or
begotten and born to God in the Knowledge and faith of his Son) by the power of
the Spirit; a people born of the Promiſe of God, or word of Promiſe, that
is, the Goſpel concerning Chriſt raiſed from the dead, and the
ſalvation that is in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24,25. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32.33.1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and 3.31. The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God, his Mind, Love, Grace
and Goodneſs therein being that water in the Word, flowing from beſide the
Altar of God, of which it behooves that men be born through the power of the
Spirit, working therein, or elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inherit the Kingdom of God.
<hi>Ezeck.</hi> 4.7. <pb n="9" facs="tcp:152283:14"/>Thats the Free-woman, the
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, the mother of us all; by this a man drawn
to Chriſt, quickened up and devoted to God in him, is made a Saint of God. So
that in this Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there are theſe two things to be minded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God in the word of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Jeſus Chriſt and his Death, Reſurrection and Mediation hath ſhined in
his love to the ſoul, and thereby hath begot and in ſome meaſure quickned
up a man to a lively hope, a hope in God, and that founded upon nothing of his
own, nor any fruit of the Law in him, whether ſorrow, humiliation,
reformation, legall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion work, indeavour, frame or vertue found in
him, but only the grace and love of God as manifeſted in Chriſt; Chriſt
dead for him, and riſen for him, and glorified of God for and to him,
received into his heart by faith, is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the hope of glory to him;
the ſight or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Chriſt crucified for him drew him in to beleeve,
not his conceited act or fruits of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving made him judge Chriſt crucified
for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the love and grace in Chriſt thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by him and giving him hope, changes him into the likeneſs of Chriſt,
principles him God-ward, puts a law of love into his heart and carries him
after God, and ſo devotes him unto God to Chriſt, to be his, and for his
praiſe. So that in a Saint of God there is neither a hope bottomed upon his
changing and endeavors; <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152283:15"/>nor yet a dead hope without a
change, but a change and renovation ſpringing from his hope, and that hope
from grace diſcovered in God by Jeſus Chriſt in the power of the
ſpirit; he hath his life in love, and lives to the God of Love. And every
ſuch ſoul as from the grace of God in Chriſt is quickened up to hope in
God, and in that hope given up to be God's &amp; Chriſt's (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
difference may be found otherwiſe in the fleſh, or in ſome opinions not
eſſentiall to the faith) is a Saint of God whether (for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes this difference)</p>
               <p n="1">1. Children, weak, and as it were but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio's, Chriſt
not yet formed in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. their apprehenſions of Gods love
in his Son but weak and ſmall, and ſo their hope and faith but little, and
weak, wavering, ſtaggering, not as yet ſetled and confirmed and made
ſtrong in Chriſt, who therefore are to be tendred and more warily walked
toward, and as it were nurſed up with wholeſome words like milk, and not
roughly dealt with, leſt they be broken, and leſt by any abuſe of our
liberties or any other way they be ſcandalized and offended. or</p>
               <p n="2">2. Young men, ſuch as are ſtrong and have overcome the
wicked one, have endured temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and have the word of God ſomewhat
ſetled and abiding in them, and therefore ablet to bear, and not ſo ſoon
ſtumbled nor in ſo great danger of miſcarrying. or</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:152283:15"/>3. Farhers, men well grown and long
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and ſo more uſefull for begetting and training up others in
the knowledge of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14.15.</p>
               <p>And to all ſuch as thus by the word of the Goſpel and the
grace or love of God therein diſcovered to them in the Death and
reſurrection of Chriſt, have been emptied of themſelves and their filthy
confidences and rejoycings, and are begot to hope in God and framed to the love
and likeneſs of God in ſome beginnings, or in further growth, do I bend my

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd firſt of all, I deſire you to minde the ſtate in
which you are, which admits of diverſe diſtinct conſiderations. For a
Saint is in a meaſure proportioned to Chriſt, and there is a great deal of
likenes between them, though alſo mixed with much unlikeneſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt had a twofold nature and diſcent, each 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152283:16"/>of which had its diſtinct properties, of God and of man;
the Son of God, and the Son of man; according to the fleſh, and according to
the Spirit; <hi>according to the fleſh of the ſeed of David, according to
the Spirit the Son of God, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be with power in the
reſurrection from the dead. Rom.</hi> 1.2.3. According to the fleſh the
Jews knew whence he was, and ſtumbled at him; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit they
knew him not whence he was, nor did acknowledge him; according to the fleſh
he was put to Death and died according to the Spirit or in the power thereof he
was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again. He was a man, a man anointed of God with the holy Ghoſt
and power: So is every reall Saint or Chriſtian, he is to be conſidered as
a man and as a Saint; as of Adam, as in Chriſt of God; according to the
humane nature that he hath by generation in the fleſh, and according to the
divine nature which he partakes of in the Spirit: He is neither all fleſh,
nor all Spirit, but hath ſomething of both; though yet neither in the ſame
way had Chriſt his fleſh as he hath; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he the Spirit in the
ſame immeaſurable fulneſs as Chriſt had; ſo that in that regard there
is alſo diſproportion between them; the very fleſh or body of Chriſt
was ſo of God that it was not by immeditate humane generation; and he was
ſo the Son of God in the Spirit that he alſo was and is God; and all the
fulneſs of gifts and grace was, and is in him: not ſo the Saint; 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152283:16"/>he hath his fleſh by humane generation as other men, and
he hath a meaſure of the gift of Chriſt in one way or other, but no one
hath all, nor can communicate to others as Chriſt can. The man Jeſus
Chriſt was the Son of God by union with the word, ſo are the Saints; but
not in the ſame manner: there <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> and the
perſon ſo made is yet called the word: here the word is united to the
ſoul by faith, yet ſo as its not made to be fleſh or man; nor the
perſon in whom it is, is made the word: there he was the word before he was
made fleſh; here the perſon neither was, nor is the word. There was Death
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh: ſo there is in the Saint; but not ſo here as
there; for <hi>Chriſt died to take away Sin</hi> and <hi>was made an offering
for ſin:</hi> but not ſo the Saint: the Saint dies becauſe of ſin in
him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, that being quickened in the Spirit he might
more gloriouſly live to God, but his Death in the fleſh makes no expiation
for ſin, nor is he the propitiation for any others therein. He alſo riſes
again with Chriſt, but not for ſuch end as Chriſt; <hi>he roſe for our
Juſtification,</hi> but not we for any others, but to enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of
that that we have in him; yea in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there is another vaſt
difference between Chriſt and the Saints, that in the Saints are theſe
three things, 1. The ſubſtance of man conſiſting of body and ſoul, 2.
The fleſh, old man, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpoſition in them; and 3. The Spirit
or <pb n="14" facs="tcp:152283:17"/>new man that luſts againſt that fleſh; but now in
Chriſt though there was fleſh of Adam and that ſubjected to infirmity
becauſe of our ſins, and Spirit or divine nature as the word of God; yet in
him there was no ſinfull diſpoſition, <hi>no guile was found in his
mouth, nor was ſin</hi> (in that regard of inherency) ever <hi>known to
him:</hi> in that he died, it was for our ſin; the <hi>chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
our peace was laid upon him, and through his ſtripes we are healed.

as alſo in regard of ſin the corrupt and curſed principle of fleſh
within you not wholly as yet outed by grace, though conquered, and put under
and faſtened to the croſſe that it might be deſtroyed; it hath yet
ſuch an exiſtence in your fleſh and nature, that it much clouds the minde
in ſeeing the things of the Spirit; much dulls the heart in, and withdraws
the affections from the cleaving to, and eager purſuit after them, yea 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152283:18"/>ſubjects you to uncomly, unſaintly practiſes and

you to whet you on further, and prepare you for the fuller injoyment; bleſs
God in Chriſt for that, and in his ſtrength paſs on yet to what is laid
up for you, to be injoyed by you in the full revelation of himſelf unto 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152283:23"/>you. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. you are entring happily, but have

Chriſt; in conformity to him in holineſs as well as in the fruition of your

and to be in him thats true, ſo ye come to like him and be made like to him:
but as your knowledge of him is not in the fulleſt degree of its perfection,
ſo neither is your like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him. Its indeed the property of true reall
faith and union with Chriſt, that as there-through <hi>we behold him, we are
changed into his likeneſs from glory to glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and
in that Saints differ from other men; other men change themſelves by looking
into the Law of works, and endeavouring to conform themſelves thereto; or
elſe reſt in a notion and are not changed, or not changed into his
likeneſs; nay many from their changes think to behold his glory; but the
Saints having firſt a true ſight of his glory, his glorious grace and love
in the glaſſe of the Goſpel or Law of liberty, are thereby changed into
his likeneſs; but not <pb n="26" facs="tcp:152283:24"/>all at one, but <hi>gradatim,</hi>
by ſteps, from glory to glory: when Saints ſhall ſee him fully, they
ſhall be fully like him, but not till then. And that you are not in this
reſpect as yet perfect, I ſuppoſe there are none of you in a right mind
but will confeſs, ſeeing you cannot but ſee the witneſſes thereof in
you; for whence elſe ariſe delights in earthly riches, honors,
apparellings, approbation? whence paſſions, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? whence high
thoughts of your ſelves, and ſecret diſtruſts of God when tryed by him
(or the like) yea whence diſeaſes and diſtempers of body, but becauſe
ye are not yet perfectly like him? there may be and are differences here too,
according to your different meaſures of knowing him and rootedneſs in him
and eying of him, but none of you but may yet go on to more perfection. Its
true the Apoſtle ſaith, ſo many as are perfect, let us to be thus minded.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. that is (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.14.) not to judge our
ſelves perfect or to have attained, but to preſs on ſtill forward.
<hi>Aſa</hi> was perfect in his heart all his dayes, and yet he impriſoned
the Prophet of God, and did not truſt as he ſhould have done in God, but
ſought unto the Phyſitians, and not unto God. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.17.
<hi>with</hi> 16.10.12. his perfection was in that he judged him the only true
God, and turned not in his heart after another God, after Baal or any other, as
ſome before him had done; but in this his perfection <pb n="27" facs="tcp:152283:24"/>he
walked not perfectly as to his ſeeking to, and walking with that God, but
ſinned greatly againſt him as is fore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>A man is ſaid to be perfect when upright in that meaſure he
hath, not guilefull, double, halting between two opinions; owning no other God
then the Lord. So <hi>Aſa</hi> was perfect, and ſo the Apoſtle in the
place quoted mentions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; <hi>ſo many as are perfect, be we thus
mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Phil.</hi> 3 15. and many are in that ſenſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
whole-hearted for God and Chriſt; but in that ſenſe I mean it not when I
ſpeak here of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: but as of that to which nothing can be further
added: a perfection in degrees: in that ſenſe I ſay the Saints are here
in a ſtate of imperfection, they have not yet that perfect conformity to
Chriſt in holineſs as they may and ſhall attain to when they perfectly
apprehend him and the glory in him; not only <hi>if we ſay we have not
ſinned,</hi> but alſo <hi>if we ſay we</hi> are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly renewed
that <hi>we have no ſin</hi> (for Chriſt to purge out and further cleanſe
us from) <hi>we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> 1
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.10. However perfect our ſtate is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the
head, and as reckoned after him, though <hi>righteous as he is righteous,</hi>
yet we that are ſo reckoned, have in our own perſons yet ſin abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in
us: though we be not in it, nor ſo looked upon; yet it is in us; and if it be
ſowen unto, it occaſions chaſtiſements too unto us that we 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152283:25"/>might deny and be purged from it; oh ye that are in
Chriſt Jeſus, deceive not your ſelves, as if becauſe perfect in him, ye

ſubtile and forcible then thoſe that are viſible; ſuch as are Angels
and Spirits, which by how much they are the purer in eſſence then any
bodily being, by ſo much the more forcible are they and able to penetrate,
having not that earthly groſſneſs in them that dulls and abates the force
of other creatures; beſides that they not being the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

the more eaſily mingle themſelves with, or inſinuate themſelves into
our ſpirits, which are ſomewhat of like nature with them; that ſuch
eſſences were created by Chriſt, is affirmed in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.
<hi>Things viſible and inviſible, &amp;c,</hi> and that ſome of theſe
leaving their firſt habitation, or principality fell from God, and are
reſerved in chains of darkneſs unto the Judgement of the great Day (which
they alſo tremble at the thoughts of) is affirmed by the Apoſtle
<hi>Jude</hi> 6. Nor need I go about to prove to you, that there are ſuch;
for I ſpeak to you that are Saints, and therefore I hope not eaſily gulled
into the error of the Sadduces, to deny that there are Angels or Spirits, or
any thing that cannot be ſeen or diſcerned with bodily ſenſes: you
cannot be Saints if ye believe no more then your ſenſes perceive; for then
neither can ye believe that there is a God, foraſmuch as with mortal eyes you
cannot ſee him, and Saints they are not that believe not in him; much leſs
that believe him not to be becauſe they cannot ſee him. The Scriptures
everywhere plentifully teſtifie to this, that there are both Angels and
Spirits, good and evil; and ſuch as I ſpeak to, are born of that Word of
Faith that is held forth in the Scriptures; elſe have they nothing to do to

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keder it is become being fallen: for wickedneſs is never ſo
dangerous as when it meets with power and knowledge to improve it: his
vigilancy to harm us proceeds from his degeneration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wickedneſs
and hatred againſt God and us. His ſubtilty is noted in his name of
Serpent, and by thoſe phraſes that tell us of his wiles and methods, as his
malice in that he is called the old red Dragon, full of wrathfull poyſon; his
ſtrength by the name of Lion; and his diligence to improve all theſe
againſt us in that he is ſaid to go about like a roaring Lyon: as if he
ſhould ſay, like as a Lyon hungry and roaring after his prey uſeth all
diligence to catch it: ſo this grand adverſary of the Saints goes about
compaſſing the earth and prying into all occaſions, diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and wayes, for opportunities to do them miſchief. He ſeekes and he walkes
about ſeeking whom he may devour, making it his buſineſs, and trying all
one by one as it were: ſifting men as wheat is ſifted in a ſeive; if he
cannot catch this man, he will try another, and if not this way, 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152283:32"/>then another: there is his eager and violent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in
this his miſchievous way; and of his ſubtilty to try all wayes and
concluſions, and to winde us in, and enſnare us, there is no room to doubt
ſeeing (as we ſaid before) he is a Spirit, and ſo hath the more inſight
into us: bodies can diſcern but bodies with their animal ſenſes; but
Spirits, eſpecially when not impeded with bodies, can pierce deeper, and
ſee ſomething far into diſpoſitions and Spirits. Men of a ſubtile
Spirit can diſcern much into others tempers and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; how much
more Satan that is a Spirit and can come nearer to our Spirits; he can
diſcern very much of mens diſpoſitions, and ſuit his temptations unto
them. He is an Artiſt in his way, and can lay a long train of temptations
ſo deeply and politickly, that none can eſpy him ſcarcely. If he ſee
men not wholly taken off of the world, but that the fleſh with its affections
and appetites after carnall objects are ſomewhat ſtirring in them, he can
find out wayes enough to enſlave them if God permit him; yea, and ſo he
catcheth many in his ſnares, inveigling them to give themſelves to ſeek
after the promotions, eaſe, liberty, applauſe, and pleaſures of the
world: and ſo by degrees he deads them to, or withdraws them from the mark of
the price of the high calling of God; and he can tell how to put on notable
viſions and pretences, as of neceſſity, betterneſs, and more fitneſs
to ſerve and <pb n="43" facs="tcp:152283:32"/>glorifie God, more advantage to the word and
way of God, &amp; many ſuch fine devices to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent men, ſo as they
ſuſpect little harm in what he leads their Spirits out to, till they ſee
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſnare and ready to be devoured by him; yea perhaps he
ſo lulls them aſleep, that they ſcarce ſee or feel it then; under
pretence of doing more good he inveigles many mens minds to love and ſeek
after more goods; and under pretence of crediting the Goſpel he leads many to
ſeek to credit themſelves in the world and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own honor, and
ſet their hearts upon earthly dignities and preferments; yea, and ſometimes
under pretence of ſpirituall union and better helpfulneſs, he provokes
ſome men to luſt and wantonneſs: oh the ſubtilty of this wicked one!
But yet in theſe things, though ſomewhat ſublimated, he appears but as a
Ruler of the darkneſs of this world, and as the God thereof ſeeking to
glorifie it, and ſnare the Saints by it, which alſo too uſually he doth.
But he is yet more admirably ſubtle in transforming himſelf into another
guiſe; coming full fraught with ſpirituall wickedneſſes in heavenly
things. He as a ſubtle Spirit can inſinuate pollutions into our Spirits in
the things of heaven, and where he ſees ſouls taken with ſuch things, can
meet them in a diſguiſe in the things they are taken with, changing his
ſhape, and clothing himſelf with an appearance of light, and preſent
himſelf <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152283:33"/>as a meſſenger, bringer, or Angel of light,
and in this way even at this time alſo, my Brethren he is moſt buſie, and
doth moſt hurt unto the Churches and Saints of God; when Satan comes to
divert Saints from ſpirituall things, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more diſcernable
(though ſo ſleightfull: juggler is he, that even there oftentimes he ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

wraps himſelf in theſe things, and pretends to help them forward in them,
then he gets the eaſier attention and entertainment. Here then that
counſell of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> is needfull to be taken by us.

bread, he tempts him to impatiency of it, and to an unuſual way to put an end
to his hunger by turning ſtones into bread, as if God that led him to a
condition wherein he denyed him the ordinary means of refreſhing, was not
able to (or would not) preſerve him by his word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe means: or as
if he could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as well to live upon Gods word without the means
when not afforded, as upon the means extraordinarily procured. And ſurely
Satan is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten buſie with the Saints to make them impatient in their
wilderneſs of waiting upon God, and carries many inordinately after thoſe
and thoſe means where they cannot in an ordinary way injoy them, as if their
life conſiſted in them, and not chiefly in the word of God believed by
them, and united to them; many a Saint he draweth down to a
diſcontentedneſs for want of viſible means in outward things; or
becauſe he injoys not ſuch an ordinance or means in the time while he is
the wilderneſs, as he thirſts or hungers for, but God in his providentiall
way affordeth not: yea by that means ſometimes he ſtirs them up to many
irregularities and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions: yea and often when they have, though
irregularly gotten what their ſouls thirſted for, by aſſuming power as
the Sons of God to make <pb n="46" facs="tcp:152283:34"/>what they have not, they take up
their reſt too much in ſuch enjoyments, as if they lived by them and not by
the word of God that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from him. But yet behold a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
temptation, in which is diſcovered more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickedneſs. For
Chriſt no ſooner had reſiſted that temptation, being ſtedfaſt in
faith and in the word of God as having it written in his heart; but then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſets upon him in another way; in which he playes
the Angel of light indeed, and fight againſt him with his own weapons: tempts
him to confidence in God, and brings the promiſe to him (which he knew muſt
needs appertain to him, he being the Son of God) to animate him to ſtep out
of the way of God. He takes him and carries him upon the top of an high
pinac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

thence to caſt down himſelf, for he being the Son of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could
harm him, and it is written that God had given his Angels charge over him to
keep him, and to bear him up by their power that he ſhould not daſh his
foot againſt a ſtone. Oh ſubtle temptation? whom would not this deceive,
but him that holds faſt the word, and hath it dwelling in him in all wiſdom
teaching and admoniſhing him? how many ſouls lifted up on high have been
precipated with this ſuggeſtion? When the Devil turns a preacher and
preſents Gods promiſes to further his inticements, whom will

temptation fitted to perſons that minde ſpirituall things; perſons that
look for promiſes to be given in to them may be eaſily thus ſnared. How
many when they have met in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with a baptiſm unto Chriſt,

               <p>Take heed of Satan in this temptation. As the common people

haſt the Word and Spirit of Wiſdom to guide thee in it; he ever comes to
divide from God; even while he tempts to lean upon him, his temptation tends to
ſeparation from him; to leave his way, and yet expect his Promiſe made to

ſpotleſs Sacrifice, we may have acceſs unto, and acceptance with him, the
onely bread of Life that God hath given us from heaven to feed upon; the great
Witneſs and Evidence of Gods Love and Goodneſs to us; the expreſs
Character, and lively Image of his Perſon; in a word, the only Saviour
appointed of God to us, in the vertues of his once offered Sacrifice, able not
only to juſtifie us at the firſt, but alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to ſave us;
therefore he makes it his main buſineſs in order to the alienating men from
God, and depriving them of eternal happineſs, to turn, or keep men out from
believing on him; even as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo doth this
wicked one indevour to beguil ſouls now, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting their minds or thoughts
(<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) from the ſimplicity that is
in him, from their ſingle looking to God in and through him. Now how did the
Serpent beguil <hi>Eve,</hi> but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her that their living by
faith in the Word of God, and in obſervance of the way of God, was a blind
low kind of living; but would ſhe be ruled by him, and liſten to his
counſel, they ſhould attain to a much better condition, live a life of
Knowledge like to God, and not in ſuch a ſubjection to, and dependance on
God; even ſo (as the Apoſtle intimates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2,3.) Satan now
ſeeks to deceive, by inſinuating into <pb n="58" facs="tcp:152283:40"/>mens thoughts,
that the Death, Sacrifice, and Mediation of Chriſt are but low, ſimple
things, fit only for Novices, and new beginners to live upon, and the living by
faith in him, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Doctrine and Ordinances, a poor
deſpicable way of living that keeps men in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſubjects them
to many exerciſes and temptations, from which would they liſten to his
counſels, he would ſoon free them, and bring them to a more godlike
condition.</p>
               <p>Thus withdraws he mens ſouls from Chriſt, and leads them,
either wholly to ſleight and trample upon him, to loath the feeding
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon him, as if he was (as the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
ſaid of their Manna) but a light bread, and to account the blood of the
Covenant but a common poor thing, and ſo to itch and covet after ſome more
ſenſual ſatisfaction, or elſe to joyn ſomething elſe with him as
the matter of their ſouls feeding and bottome of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence towards
God, and way of approaching to him, as if there was not the fulneſs of God in
him; or as if he was not compleat, nor had done ſo much in and by his one
once offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as that in and with the vertues of it he is perfectly
furniſhed for leading up his ſanctified ones unto perfection; but that
however he and the Doctrine of him are meet to bring in ſouls to God at the
firſt: yet after men are once <pb n="59" facs="tcp:152283:40"/>brought in, they muſt
look after ſome other more excellent thing, (even as the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> duſted in the Wilderneſs for fleſh) to bring them
to perfection. Thence the ſpirit of Anti-Chriſt (which is the very ſpirit
and inſpiration of Satan) is Charactarized and deſcribed by his denying
Jeſus to be the Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. and 4.2,3. makeing but a Type
or Figure or Fancy of him, or not by confeſſing him come in the fleſh;
that is, he magnifieth not, or commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to men, but as much as in him
lieth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, ſlighteth, ſpeaks overly, and makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of
the Abaſement, Humiliation, Death, Sufferings, and Sacrifice of the Lord
Jeſus, and ſo the whole buſineſs of his coming in the fleſh, either
more directly and openly, or elſe more cloſely and by conſequence;
whereas God and his Spirit takes the things of Chriſt, and ſhews them to
men, leading them there to have their conſtant and continual feeeding,
incouragement to Hope, and matter of Conſolation.</p>
               <p>And indeed did not Satan ſome way or other prevail with men,
either to keep them from Chriſt, or to withdraw them when they have begun to
look towards him, he ſhould nothing avail in all his attempts againſt them,
ſeeing life is ſo intailed upon him, and put into, him that he cannot
miſs it poſſibly that miſſes not of him. But alas his deſign is
accompliſhed in too many <pb n="60" facs="tcp:152283:41"/>men, though all are not in the
ſame way deceived by him. Some he ſo hoodwinks, and keeps in darkneſs,
that they not ſeeing Chriſt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God freely given to
them, go about to eſtabliſh to themſelves a righteouſneſs of their
own, and ſubmit not to him, truſt not in his Grace but in their own works,
thinking that for the goodneſs thereof, or as it were thereby Chriſt will
ſave them.</p>
               <p>Others he perſwads to reſt in a Notion and profeſſion of
the truths of Chriſt, though they diſcern not, nor imbrace not Chriſt
himſelf, and his Sacrifice in their hearts, nor the love of God commended
therein to them.</p>
               <p>Others he more ſubtly ſnares with a conceit of faith, the
riſe and ſpring whereof is not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his Sacrifice, and the
love of God therein manifeſted to them, while ſinners &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and
nothing better then others, but ſome diſpoſition, frame, work, or ſome
Word or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe applyed to them by their own reaſonings, or brought to
their minds, in which yet the Lord Jeſus was not diſcovered to, or ſet
before them.</p>
               <p>But yet more ſubtly and ſpeciouſly he plays the Serpent
indeed, when by pretending to bring them to a better condition then what they
have by the faith of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he ſecretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines them, and
draws them from him; of <pb n="61" facs="tcp:152283:41"/>which I deſire we may
eſpecially beware, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he often comes with great artifice and
cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. He can ſuck poyſon out of Hony, and uſher in ſome way of
darkneſs with words of light, as we have already ſeen, wreſt ſome
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſaying to turn the eye and heart from <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom they
all ſpeak on.</p>
               <p>He will come and tell men that the Death and Reſurrection of
Chriſt, and ſo his Sacrifice and Mediation are things without men; and what
good will they do to the ſoul if lived and fed on? Men muſt have Chriſt
in them the hope of glory; and ſo doth ſome times ſubtly draw men from
what he propounds from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them. For that Chriſt muſt be in
men the hope of glory, is a very pretious truth, the thing that above all other
I would prefer thee to, and wiſh thee to take heed of being beguiled of; but
Satan means not ſo; leſs when he brings that ſaying: For whereas Chriſt
is indeed in the Believer (that is in his heart, knowledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,

to be in the hearts of men) as he was made fleſh<note n="*" place="bottom">See

built himſelf an Houſe in man, even his people, Chriſt and his members,
by whom he ſpeaks and works to the drawing in others to God, and edifying
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in whom he dwels, imploying them to be his mouth in the opening

inſinuating himſelf into men, hath his dwelling in them, and becomes a

               <p>Of theſe I ſay that have forſaken the pathes of
uprightneſs to walk in the wayes of darkneſs: men that have let go the
Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles to walk in their own ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
making the Apoſtles to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers of Apologues and fables in which
there was no truth or verity, but only a ſhadow and parable of another thing:
people that indeed deny the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: ſome, that there was never
ſuch a one; others, that he was no more then a bare man, a patern, an
example; not the Saviour of the world indeed, but only a type and figure of the
true Saviour, ſo evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating him, and denying him to be their Lord, Ruler,
and Commander, or Mediator between God and men, turning all into an Allegory or
vain fancy; undermining and ſubverting the faith of Chriſt; as if he were
but a fleſhly Chriſt, and the faith in him though begotten by Gods Spirit,

live by faith in him, but alas, you live low and carnally; that was but a

ſuch a one there ever was) and the faith of his diſciples in him died with
him (ſo ſome have not ſhamed to write) but we have Chriſt in the Spirit

theſe and ſuch like are the hony combs that drop from their lips, the

them from it. And indeed whom would not ſuch fair ſpeeches catch and carry
away? Who would not long to lick at ſuch hony drops, and kiſſe the lips
that are ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious? who would not beleeve ſuch fair flouriſhes, when
they tell them alſo they are their experiences? eſpecially when they that
hear are unſetled and impatient to follow their Jeſus through tryals, and
wait upon him for his glorious happineſſe: many ſtrong men have fallen by
her ſaith Wiſdom, and few or none that turn in to her are able to get out
again, but are ſo in wrapped in her ſnares, and find ſo much
pleaſantneſs in her deceits: have ſuch ſtrong fancies and deluſions
of joy, peace, liberty, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, happineſs here already (God giving them up
thereto) with ſuch a free run to ſerve the fleſh too, that they follow on
ſtill as an oxe to the ſlaughter, and as a fool to the ſtocks, till a

are in the depths of hell, yet they are not ſenſible of it, they know it
not, till Chriſt by the brightneſs of his coming and breath of his mouth
ſhall awake them, and fill their ſouls with horror.</p>
               <p>This is the way by which they beguile the ſimple and

bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall not riſe again and be made glorious and immortall; as alſo
to the ſame purpoſe they alledge, that the body returns again to the

is no being of Chriſt without and diſtinct from men, and that Chriſt is

(ſome of them) and know no difference between good and evil; thoſe actions
that they did before, and judged evil according to the Scripture, are now no
ſin in them what ever they be: and now they are as high (they think) as
<hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt ſtate (if ever there was ſuch a one) they know
neither good nor evil, though they do much evil and no good: and then they can

taſte on: look unto Jeſus the Author (or leader in) and finiſher of our

there are aguinſt us, <hi>the ſhout of a King is amongst us,</hi> and
<hi>Greater is he that is in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, then He that is in the</hi> world

<hi>no good thing, if we walk uprightly before him, will he withhold from us.

he will order all well for us, and ſhew us his goodneſs and ſalvation.
On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rebell not we againſt the Lord, nor willingly withdraw our ſelves
from him, and he will ſecure us. Be ſtrong in his might and power which he
gives unto us in Chriſt, and we ſhall not need to fear what fleſh can do
unto us, or what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities and powers can do againſt us. <hi>For if
God be for us</hi> (as he is) <hi>who ſhall be againſt us? Rom.</hi> 8.31.
Provoke we not him againſt us by <pb n="96" facs="tcp:152283:59"/>departing from him
through an unbelieving heart, and then his alone preſence with us will drive
out our adverſaries before us, and bring us to the poſſeſſion of our
heavenly inheritance, even of all the bleſſing to which he hath called us:
we have in Chriſt as well proviſion for our way, as poſſeſſion at
our journeys end. <hi>It is God that juſtifies us in him,</hi> and owns us as
his Saints, <hi>who is it then that ſhall lay any thing againſt us?
Rom.</hi> 8.33. Who is he that condemneth us in compariſon of him that takes
part with us to clear us? what are our own corruptions within us, and Satan and
all the world againſt us to oppoſe us, ſo long as God is on our ſide to
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us? <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,
Rom.</hi> 8.1. and 7.20,21,23. Though Sin dwell in them and often carry them
captive to what they would not, and impede and hinder them in the good they
would, ſo long as they ſow not to that Sin, yield not up themſelves to
the fleſh to walk after it, but after the Spirit, Chriſt that hath died,
and roſe again is at the right hand of God and maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for
them for help and ſuccour, yea, he <hi>is mediating the new Teſtament for
them, that they might not fail of the promiſed inheritance, Heb.</hi>

not called us to this warfare at our own charges; he will maintain us; nor
ſends he us naked againſt ſo potent powers, or leaves us to our
weakneſs to provide our ſelves weapons to defend us; His Name ſhall be
<hi>Protection</hi> to us: In Chriſt he hath therein alſo compleated us;
only put we on what he hath prepared for us; and in his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we ſhall
find ſure ſtrength and victory, and none ſhall harm us. It was a great

Judge will give unto us in the day of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to be like him, to ſee
as we are ſeen, to reign upon the earth, to be with him on his throne in his
glory, joy and felicity: a glory that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor
can enter into the heart of man to conceive, yea, though we have the Spirit of
wiſdom and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the firſt fruits given us, &amp; ſo are helped
in ſome meaſure to apprehend the riches of that glory: yet it appears not
what we ſhalbe, nor can it be fully here comprehended by us. The lively hope
of this if it abide &amp; remain in us will be as an helmet and defence unto
us: it wil make us lift up our heads with boldneſs, and not fear to paſs 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152283:64"/>through ſufferings and difficulties: it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Satan in the Beaſt, and from thoſe too that lead to diſtruſt and
deſperatneſs. If by any means we ſhould be corrupted from this hope, and
be drawn to think there is no other life but this preſent, no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
happineſs and perfection, then is here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, no other heaven but our
preſent injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when this life is done all is done with us, or all

and the body to the duſt there to be conſumed, and from thence never more
to be raiſed, we muſt needs then ſtagger and be dazzeled, yea quite

a man will be unſtable and not regard the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as he
will judge it in vain and profitleſs: yea if the hope of Salvation be

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this, ſeeing I ſpeak to Saints, the
Anſwer is not difficult; for they that are ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, do in ſome
meaſure know the Truth and are born of it, do know the Righteouſneſs of
God and have believed in it, have been begotten by the Goſpel of Peace, and
quickned by it, have faith in God and Chriſt, and the hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through it: And the Exhortation is to hold faſt, and put on what they have
already known and met with; that Truth that hath begun to free them, that
Righteouſneſs of God in which he hath juſtified them, that Goſpel that
hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten them, that Faith there through wrought in them, &amp; that hope
of ſalvation that is therein ſet before them; only becauſe they that are
weak in a day of temptation, are oftentimes through the cunning and policy of
Satan to be miſled, that they call in queſtion what they have known and met
with; and thats one main work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to lead to queſtion them, either by
preſenting other things as more ſpecious, or the ſame but 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152283:65"/>corrupted; therefore its needful that we mind what the
Apoſtle further adds as uſeful for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection herein in that ſixth of
the <hi>Epheſians. viz.</hi>

no divine Truth in it; That will diſcover and drive back all aſſailants.
The VVord of God, thats the immortal ſeed that the Believer is born of; and
this is he ſtill to covet after, that he may grow by it: This <hi>David</hi>
his in his heart, that he might not ſin againſt God; and indeed that's the
beſt preſervative from ſin, and direction in Righteouſneſs, when its
ſo hidden: This is the Truth, and diſcovers the true Righteouſneſs of
God, is preached in and declares the Goſpel, is the Mother and Nurſe of
right Faith, the word of Faith and of Salvation; yea, this is a <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn
to our feet, and a light unto our paths.</hi> In this the Spirit worketh, and

all wiſdom; it will teach and admoniſh you; it will ſhew you the right

ſay, hid in your hearts and dwell there, ſo as that you know, love,

2.7. that believe, and obey them in ſincerity. And <pb n="111" facs="tcp:152283:66"/>indeed this (as Cha. 3. Sect. 6. was before hinted) is worthy to be
minded, that thats the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and right believing, which purely and
ſingly cloſeth with God and Chriſt, not for or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our
ſenſible experiments and feelings ſo much as for and according to the
Soveraign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, and his infallible and moſt pure ſayings, that
believes the Word, though it ſee not any probability as to Senſe or
Reaſon of the things there declared; That Faith thats built upon Senſe (as
we have ſhewed) alters and varies often according to the alterations in
ſenſe, as we ſhewed in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who ſo long as ſome
great work was in their eye, and ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction apprehended in their
ſenſe believed the VVord, and ſang his Praiſe: but when thoſe great
things were withdrawn, and danger and death ſurrounded them, they
diſtruſted, murmured and rebelled; the Word of God was of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or
force with them, becauſe it was not the bottom of their faith, nor abode in
them; So fares it now alſo with many ſouls that receive the Word as the
ſtony ground doth the Seed with joy for a time, ſo long as there is no
trial, but all ſeems to go along with, and demonſtrate the thing that is
ſpoken to, and believed by them; but when ſuch ſenſible feelings or
ſatisfactions to Reaſon fail, and trials come, then in a day of temptation
they fall away; they wither in a year of drought, as it were not having
moiſture <pb n="112" facs="tcp:152283:67"/>enough from the Word within to cauſe them to
abide in a patient waiting upon God for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious returns to them; the
Goſpel of Peace hath not prepared them for a long travel or trial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
not heartily and throughly received and cleaved to by them in the love of it,
nor well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in them; therefore they have no patience, but fall to
murmuring, repining, and inordinate luſting after ſenſible feelings of
comfort: and God deferring them, they either run back to the world again,
reſolving to have its conſolations rather then none: or elſe, if any
Doctrine or Spirit under pretence of Gods come unto them and promiſe them
feedom from ſuch ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and long waitings, though it be from
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and lead them quite from the faith of Jeſus to ſome ſtrong
deluſion, they embrace and run after it to their own deſtruction;
preferring ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible feelings and flaſhes of joy and comfort, and
raptures, &amp;c. though from falſe and failing deluſions of Satan,
withdrawing them from the VVord, before a patient hoping in a dark exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
condition in the VVord for its unſpeakable and eternal conſolations.</p>
               <p>Surely from this ſometimes ſouls are miſled, and given
over to believe or rejoyce in a lye, as if they were now at prefect freedom,
and as fully poſſeſſed of heaven as ever any ſhall be, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Reſurrection already as much as any ſhall or can attain to; yea were
Godhead with <pb n="113" facs="tcp:152283:67"/>God, and made parts of his indiviſible
Eſſence, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan mounting them up aloft, and cauſing them to ſpeak great
ſwelling words of vanity, and ſhine as Comets to the admiration of others;
he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf into an Angel of light, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them it
is the true Light that they ſee and glory in, though in the iſſue they go
out in darkneſs, and have the blackneſs of it reſerved for them; whereas
on the other ſide where the Word of God is in the heart, and the meditation
thereon day and night, and the hope in the Lord Jehovah, there-through and
according thereto it will preſerve and perfect that man to the inheritance,
being the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believes,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. a pure, infallible, and ſure Word that will not fail or
deceive any. Happy is he that though he ſee not, or prove little or nothing
in his own ſenſe, yet believeth according to what is ſaid in that; that
will give comfort, ſtrength, greenneſs, growth, fruitfulneſs, and
preſerve the ſoul in patience to everlaſting happineſs; and the fruits
that ſpring up in the ſoul from that, are very good and acceptable: Thus
<hi>Abraham</hi> believed and ſaw not, and his faith grounded on the Word was
ſtedfaſt; the ſenſible deadneſs of his own body, and decay of natural
ſtrength, nor the known and proved barrenneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb,
cauſed him not to ſtagger, but the Word wrought effectually in him to keep
him in <pb n="114" facs="tcp:152283:68"/>a patient waiting upon God for the
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the thing that was ſpoken; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>when he
had patiently waited he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Promiſe, Heb</hi> 6.15. (the firſt
fruits, or ſome particulars in it; for he died in Faith, not having received
much of it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.) in a better way then <hi>Sarahs</hi> haſty
counſel of turning in to <hi>Hagar</hi> could have brought about.</p>
               <p>The Word of God, the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being received in
a good, ſingle, honeſt heart, brings forth fruit with patience,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the heart to waite upon God in his way, keeps it from
carefulneſs in a year of drought, when ſenſe is not ſatisfied by more
flowing feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of conſolation from the pourings out of Spirit, but as
faith comforteth in looking to the Word, and yet it leads the heart to long and
thirſt after thoſe flowing conſolations promiſed in the Word, in the
way of the VVord; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after which, and rejoycing in the injoyments
of which, I would not be miſtook as if I daſht againſt them, or at all
faulted; It were better for me that my right hand ſhould be withered, then
write a word to take the heart off from preſſing after them in the way of
believing; but onely from the botoming our faith upon the ſenſible feelings
of them, and not upon the VVord, that leads to wait for them in Gods way, and
firms the ſoul againſt haſt-making, and againſt the ready liſtening
to other doctrines <pb n="115" facs="tcp:152283:68"/>promiſing greater liberty and freedom
(or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) then the VVord of God declares to us, or can there be found
for our inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Take you therefore heed, beloved, to the VVord of God, to
believe what he hath ſaid by the mouth of all his holy Apoſtles and
Prophets; meditate ye in his Law night and day, and try the doctrines, yea and
the Spirits too that come unto you, by their conſonancy with thoſe divine
ſayings, and count accurſed what ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, or leadeth you therefrom,
from, or beſides the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. (I mean) as declared
therein, ſo ſhall you be able to quit your ſelves as men, defending your

their Temptations.</p>

hath ſpoken by the mouth of his Servants; which (that none might cheat us) he
hath ordered, and cauſed to be alſo written and recorded (ſo much as his
wiſdom hath ſeen meet and ſufficient for our helpfulneſs) in the holy
Scriptures, which ceaſeth not to be his VVord becauſe written down, but
becomes of greater uſefulneſs to us, for whoſe ſakes they were ſo
written; though the letters and ſyllables as written, are but humane
inſtruments of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over what was by God ſpoken; yet thoſe divine

are in themſelves ſpiritual, and full of divine operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abſtractedly

               <p>By theſe then heeded and minded, ſhall you ſee what is

5.11. ſome read <hi>for my ſake;</hi> ſome <hi>for righteouſneſs
ſake;</hi> either of them right and both come to one and the ſame thing:
many ſuch like differences I might inſtance, which do but manifeſt that
while men have copied out theſe ſacred writings they have ſometimes
either through heedleſneſs or through difficulty of right diſcerning or
reading ſome word overſlipt or altered ſome particles or words,
ſometimes ſetting down ſome other of a like or neer ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
agreeable to the ſenſe and ſcope of the Text: and ſometimes perhaps
ſomething being noted in the margin by way of conference of like places in
the ſeveral Evangeliſts, ſome word or ſaying hath thence been afterward
looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as pertaining to the Text, and hath been by others inſerted
thereinto; for ſo ſometimes ſome word or ſentence in ſome copies
inſerted in ſome Hiſtory in <hi>Matthew,</hi> or <hi>Mark</hi> more then
other copies have, is found in the ſame Hiſtory in <hi>Luke</hi> or
<hi>John</hi> by conſent of all copies.</p>
               <p>And this is clear that there is nothing of faith 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152283:73"/>about which there are diverſities of readings, but what
other places in which all copies agree, will guide us to diſcern what is
conſonant to truth of them, and which of them is corrupted and doth
diſagree; nor any paſſage of weight in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived copies out of which
our Bibles are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which other places in which all copies agree,
will not confirm; as in that moſt weighty place about which there are divers
readings, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. there are three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp;c. which ſome copies have not, but moſt have; the Scripture elſe
where atteſts it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth; for we have the ſame there in
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.33. clearly ſpoken of, and all agreeing
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into one, as ſome read it: and
again in <hi>Mat.</hi> 29.19. with divers other places, which there is no
difference or variety of reading in.</p>
               <p>Nay we find the Holy Ghoſt ſometimes vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word in the
Scripture; and while the ſame truth is held forth, though with ſome variety
of expreſſion, its ſtill divine truth and not for that variety in
expreſſion to be rejected: as where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, Thou ſhalt
worſhip the Lord thy God, and ſhalt ſerve him: our Saviour repeats it
againſt Satan thus, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him only
ſhalt thou ſerve: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being both the ſenſe of that place and the
ſcope of divers other Scriptures: it was no untruth to ſay it was ſo
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: this objection then is only a frivolous rub put in the way &amp; not
to be regarded; theſe varieties <pb n="125" facs="tcp:152283:73"/>of readings being found
either in matters not eſſentiall to the faith; or if in ſuch, yet then
they are either ſo ſmall that they no way alter the truth propounded, or
are in other places cleared, and the right reading atteſted.</p>
               <p>I know ſome object againſt the tranſlating of them that we
have them not in their proper language, and there is great difference in
tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and one Miniſter corrects one place, and another another:
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>A ſorry objection too; for 1. we have them in their Originall
languages, though all underſtand them not there. 2. That languages or words
are <hi>ſignarerum,</hi> the expreſſions of things and not the things
themſelves expreſſed, and that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the ſound, or name of
a thing in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall languages alters not the thing ſo different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named
is clear; and that interpretation is needfull in languages not underſtood to
make them underſtandible is as evident: and that there are certain Idioms and
properties of ſpeech in every language which are ſcarce ſo fully to be
expreſſed in other languages as in their own, is confeſt too by all that
underſtand languages; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that there is variety of ſignification of
ſome words in moſt (eſpecially the Hebrew and Greek) languages, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
ſometimes render ſentences ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dubious as well in the Original as
to the tranſlators; and ſometime one tranſlator takes a word in one
ſignification, ſometimes in another; <pb n="126" facs="tcp:152283:74"/>which are not
caſes often obvious, but that the ſcope of the place &amp; matter evidence
what the uſe of the word there is, though ſometimes it doth not ſo
clearly but that there may be diverſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions about it: yet this
being uſually in things leſs eſſential to the faith, no divine truth
eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to our beleeving in God and walking aright with him, is thereby
left uncertain; only ſome inſtruction or relation of things for our
learning and further helpfulneſs or conſolation (in the things otherwhere
many times more clearly and without all doubt aſſerted) is not ſo fully
made out in ſome tranſlations as in others: which doth but ſhew an
uſefulneſs in giving diligence to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and make out the properties
of the Originall languages by men of learning, not at all that we are to
ſlight the divine truths made out to us by the good hand of God upon thoſe
who have done their endeavours herein by tranſlating them for us:
eſpecially ſeeing we have almoſt generally left to us in the margin of
ſome editions the diverſity of the ſignifications in which ſuch dubious
places may be taken, that we might conſider them both, and take either of
them as God ſhall preſent inſtructions to us from them: and yet the
rather too, ſeeing the great myſteries of God and Jeſus Chriſt are in
clear and undoubted expreſſions in all tranſlations amongſt us ſo
unanimouſly repreſented, as that nothing but ſloth or unbelief or
wickedneſs can <pb n="1127" facs="tcp:152283:74"/>be the hinderance of our attaining to
ſo much of them as may lead us to and preſerve us in the way of
ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But yet neither is this all: there is yet another wile of Satan
that prevails much with many, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures have another
meaning then what the words import; a ſpirituall, myſtical, or Allegorical
ſenſe which is the true ſenſe: and therefore they are not indeed to be
rejected but ſtudied: yet not to ſtick to the literal expreſſion, but
to find out the ſpiritual that is the allegorical ſenſe: and this comes
moſt up to the old Serpent, who did not at the firſt ſay, God never
ſaid ye ſhall not eat, but hath <hi>God indeed ſaid, or in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſaid ye ſhall not eat, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, though them
words ye heard, yet do you think that was the meaning of them? there was ſome
other thing in that ſaying then you think of, and not that which the words
ſeem to import: this is a very ſpecious temptation and takes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and the other forementioned are often made of uſe to uſher in this.</p>
               <p>In anſwering which, this I ſhall ſay, that 1. All
Scripture in one ſenſe hath a ſpirituall ſenſe, as by ſpirituall
ſenſe we mean the ſenſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or that the Spirit holds forth;
but then that is moſt uſually no other but what the words hold forth and
expreſs, as there is one god, one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man, the man
Chriſt Jeſus who gave himſelf a ranſome for all: the 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152283:75"/>ſenſe of the Spirit in that is as is expreſt in
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> words, and ſo uſually in
other places. 2. Many Scriptures are indeed parabolically and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
expreſt, and there the Spirit had a further aime then at what the letter of
the parable ſpeaketh: but uſually in ſuch places too the holy Ghoſt
diſcovers himſelf to ſpeak by way of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or ſimilitude; as when
its ſaid, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is like leaven, and like muſtard. ſeed
&amp;c. in which kinde of expreſſions the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tels us that the
ſayings are parabolicall: ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things are ſpoken of and ſet
forth under earthly ſimilitudes: of which ſort alſo are the
deſcriptions of God oftentimes under bodily notions, as of hands, feet,
wings, &amp;c. and of Chriſt under the Metaphoricall terms of a door, a vine,
a Shepherd, &amp;c. which ſay in effect that what thoſe things are in their
ſeveral relations to the earthy things they pertain to, that is Chriſt to
his people; and theſe alſo are eaſie enough to any eaſie
underſtanding, to be figurative and parabolicall; yea 3. I deny not but there
may often be an alluſive uſe made of many Scriptures to illuſtrate other
things by, then what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and directly ſpeak to: which is indeed an
Allegorical uſe: as <hi>Paul</hi> make uſe of the Hiſtory of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> having two ſons to repreſent the ſeverall conditions of
two ſorts of people that claim acquaintance with God, and that by thoſe two
Doctrines of Law and Goſpel, are begot to <pb n="129" facs="tcp:152283:75"/>worſhip him:
and ſo many things that befell the people in the wilderneſs may be alluded
to as reſemblances and repreſentations of what doth often befall men in
their paſſage from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world and Satan, to the
enjoyment of the eternall inheritance: as Gods leading them with a cloud may
inſtruct us into Gods guiding his people that follow him in the faith of
Chriſt, and his ſo protecting them by that faith, that no ſpiritual
temptation, or outward perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhal ſcorch or harm them: and his
leading them by a pillar of fire we may allude to, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his
giving light and hope unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in times of their darkneſſe and
afflictions: ſo we may allude to the ſtory of <hi>Orpahs</hi> being
perſwaded to leave her mother in law <hi>Naomi, Ruth</hi> 1. in ſetting
forth the ſlightly cleaving of hypocrites unto Chriſt: and to
<hi>Ruths</hi> ſtedfaſt cleaving to her in ſetting forth the affection of
ſincere and honeſt-hearted beleevers unto Chriſt; many ſuch apt
alluſions there may be to things done and ſaid in former times and recorded
in the Scriptures; even as Chriſt ſets forth the way and uſefulneſs of
his exaltation by comparing it to the lifting up of the brazen Serpent in the
wilderneſs; and is ſet forth as our ſpiritual paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with
alluſion to the typical of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but yet in theſe
caſes we are to minde, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hiſtories that we ſo allude to
are fables, and things compoſed only to that very purpoſe 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152283:76"/>to ſet forth ſome ſuch other ſpirituall things
without any reality or truth in themſelves as Hiſtorical narrations; for
that would be all one as to ſay there is no ſuch creature as the ſun, nor
other uſe of it but to be a repreſentation of the Sun of righteouſneſs
in the things written and ſpoken of it, becauſe he in Scripture is ſet
forth by it; or ſuch a weapon as a ſhield, but only ſomething is ſpoken
of under ſuch a name to ſet forth God and Chriſt unto us; which would be
evident falſhoods.</p>
               <p>Nor much leſs is that another fable, ſhadow, or feined
figure that is illuſtrated and ſet forth by way of alluſion to them: as
if the Paſſeover was a type of a type, a figure of Chriſt which is
nothing according to the Hiſtory penned of him, but a pretty deviſed
repreſentation of another thing; ſure that that hath a ſhadow hath in it
ſelf ſome ſubſtance that is pointed to and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in that
ſhadow.</p>
               <p>Its one thing to ſet forth one by another in way of
ſimilitude or alluſion (in which alſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and underſtanding are
to be uſed, leaſt we make ſimilitudes where there is none, or ſtrain
ſimilitudes made by the Holy Ghoſt beyond what he maketh uſe of them or
intendeth in them) and the taking away the being of the things to which we
allude, and allowing them no other being but by way of repreſentation as too
many that ſo allude to the Creation of the <pb n="131" facs="tcp:152283:76"/>world in the
new creation, that they evacuate the truth delivered concerning the firſt
Creation, and ſtrain the ſimilitude fondly, playing in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and
pride of their wits to the detriment and obſcuring of the faith; ſuch
wantonneſs we are to beware of: but much more I ſay when not onely the
ſhadow but the ſubſtance too is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated: for</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture in the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus and
all things needfull to be beleeved to ſalvation, doth not only uſe
ſimilitudes to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſet them forth, but alſo is plain, full
and more evident, ſo as that in ſome places or other the myſteries are
declared in the very Scripture ſayings; as about the perſon and natures of
Chriſt, his incarnation, growing up, teaching, working miracles, dying,
riſing, aſcending, the end of all this, the obligation that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us
to God thereby with the whole way of ſalvation, what we are to do that we may
live, and what that life is that we ſhall have in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo far as
can be made out to our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by word and Doctrine, or is needfull
ſo to be, to make the expreſſions about which alſo to be but ſhadowes
of other things, when as the Scripture tels us they are the things that were
foreſhadowed out, is horrible miſtake and very dangerous; what Chriſt
ſpake in the dark, he hath commanded the Apoſtles to ſpeak in the light,
and to proclaim more openly to the world <pb n="132" facs="tcp:152283:77"/>the myſteries
and ſecrets that he more hiddenly propounded to them, which they alſo did
reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſtery of God, and not yet hiding it in parabolical and
ſhadowy words; as is plain by what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays. 2
<hi>Peter</hi> 1.16. <hi>We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables when
wee made known to you the power and coming of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Now what
is that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or fable, but properly a
hidden myſtical kinde of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as the heathen uſed in their
myſteries and to repreſent ſome ſecret Doctrines; yea ſometimes the
ſervants of God have uſed ſuch ſpeakings too; as <hi>Jotham</hi> when
he reproved the men of <hi>Shechem</hi> for chuſing <hi>Abimelech King,</hi>
and <hi>Abimelech</hi> for his uſurpation and Tyranny, by telling them of the
trees going to chuſe a King. <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. in which its evident that he
meant not that ever there was ſuch a thing as trees chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a King, or
that the olive and vine could make ſuch anſwers: but in that parabolical
and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way of ſpeaking (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) wiſely invented and deviſed he plainly taxed the folly of the
people, and <hi>Abimelechs</hi> wickedneſs and ambition; and that was the
only truth that he aimed at in his ſo ſpeaking to them; ſo
<hi>Aeſop</hi> a ſubtile deviſer of parabolical ſpeakings or fables,
when he would inſinuate good counſels, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove bad mens folly, he tels
many pretty ſtories; as that a cock ſcratching up a dunghill found a Jewel,
and finding it wiſht rather that he had <pb n="133" facs="tcp:152283:77"/>found a kernel
of Barley; in which he intended not to tell a real ſtory of any Dunghill
Cock, but under that deviſed (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
or) Fable, to ſet forth the folly of vain men, who, if they light of ſome
pretious Truth, or meanes of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, prize it not, but prefer ſome
ſmall worldly commodities or pleaſures before it, as better ſuiting their
principles and diſpoſitions; and ſo under a Tale of a Frog and a Mouſe
fighting, till the Kite catch them both up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them, he ſets forth
the way and iſſue of civil diſſentions, in which while both parties
fight againſt each other, they both become a prey to ſome third common and
more potent enemy; And under the Tale of a Dog paſſing over the water with
a piece of meat in his mouth, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſhadow of it, and looſing
the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he declares how fooliſh vain men having ſome
ſubſtantial Truth, and catching at ſome vain ſhadow of Truth, as if it
were another or a more ſubſtantial truth, looſe, and fall from that
ſubſtantial Truth that before they were poſſeſt of: Such is the
nature of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a deviſed Fable. Now
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that they did not ſo declare the coming
of Chriſt, as if what they declared of Chriſt as born of a Virgin, the
<hi>Word made fleſh,</hi> and as oppoſed by <hi>Herod</hi> and other
enemies, working Miracles, dying, riſing, and aſcending, was but a witty
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of ſomething done within them; <pb n="134" facs="tcp:152283:78"/>as of
Truth born in an honeſt and innocent heart, and there oppoſed by Corruption
and Luſt, yet after ſome ſtrength attained, teaching many good
Leſſons to the ſoul, and doing great works in it, curing its blindneſs,
healing its lameneſs, inlivening it from its deadneſs; ſometimes again
ſtifled as it were by corruption and darkneſs, but yet after a while
getting the upper hand again, and obtaining a more glorious conqueſt,
raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul, and carrying it up into heavenly joyes and
conſolations. Verily if this had been the thing the Apoſtles meant in
ſpeaking of Chriſt, his Incarnation, Sufferings, Teachings, &amp;c. and all
the Hiſtory of Chriſt, but deviled to ſet this forth, they have declared
as plain and manifeſt, and yet as wiſely a deviſed Fable as ever
<hi>Aeſop</hi> deviſed to repreſent his moral inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: But the
Apoſtle tells us leſt we ſhould be beguiled and led into ſuch a fancy,
that they did not follow any ſuch thing when they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, but
told us a true Hiſtory, and that that was the <hi>true Grace</hi> into which
they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12.. Its a truth indeed, and that
plainly aſſerted too in the Scriptures, that while w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> behold the glory of the Lord with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face, as in a
Glaſs we are transformed into the ſame image, &amp;c. that there is a great
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the word of eſſence, or <hi>Word</hi> that is
<hi>God</hi> made fleſh in the perſon of Chriſt, and the Word or
revelation of the grace of <hi>God</hi> in Chriſt <pb n="135" facs="tcp:152283:78"/>united
to our hearts by faith; this conforms us unto Chriſt in Death and
Reſurrection: It is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by corruption; and growing up, getting roote,
or dwelling richly in us, teaches and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us and keeps us ſafe in
the midſt of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from being overcome of it; yea, inaſmuch as the
Spirit of Chriſt is in it, it gives the ſoul underſtanding, and fills it
with life, power, and ſalvation; or rather, Chriſt doth all this by it,
through his Spirit's working effectually in it; poſſibly to corruption at
ſome time may cloud and dead its operations in ſome hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and
day of deſertion; and it may break forth again, and ſhine more gloriouſly
in the ſoul after ſuch a condition by the power of the Spirit quickning it
in us, and it may then raiſe us up in our ſpirits more gloriouſly, and
lead us up to heavenly conſolations; and all theſe things may be found
atteſted in the Scriptures; but yet this is not that coming of Chriſt in
the fleſh, the Death, and Reſurrection of him declared in the Goſpel; but
in ſome things the fruit of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt God, or of his hiding
his face by way of trial of our faith, and in other things the fruit and
operation of the Spirit of God ſent unto us in Chriſt Name, who ſuffered,
and roſe for us: We are to diſtinguiſh between the ſufferings of the
Humanity in the perſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> with its
Reſurrection, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his being made Lord and Chriſt, &amp;c. and the 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152283:79"/>conformity of the Humanity to him in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by the
working of his divine Spirit in them through the faith of him; and not make the
things affirmed of the head meet deviſed things to ſet forth Truth in the
members: nay, deny the head and make him but a fained type of the members, as
they that <hi>hold not the head, Col.</hi> 2.19. or aſcribe not to the
Humanity that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, roſe, and aſcended, or to Chriſt as in it, the
true nature of a head.</p>
               <p>I am the larger in this, becauſe it having a ſhew of
wiſdom, beguiles many from the <hi>head of all principality and power the
Lord Jeſus, Col.</hi> 2.8.10. and as was foretold by the Apoſtle, cauſes
them to turn aſideto Fables, or rather to turn the Goſpel into a Fable.
This turning all into an Allegory is as notable a baite as any Satan can fiſh
with; for if a man be once brought to that, that he thinks the Scriptures hold
not forth the mind of the Spirit in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its expreſſions, but
ſpeak of other things: then it will follow that the literal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
will not be much heeded, but ſome ſpiritual pretended myſtery looked for
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the things ſpoken of; and then Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf transforming
himſelf into an Angel of light, may pretend to declare or ſuggeſt that
true ſpiritual meaning, and the ſoul hath nothing in the Word left certain
by taking heed to which it may dicover him; the Scriptures being now 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152283:79"/>made to it, like to the Philoſophers firſt matter,
<hi>Omnium formarum capax,</hi> fit to be interpreted by any new deviſe or
figment that hath a ſhew of wit and ſubtilty in it, as the ſpiritual
ſenſe of it; yea, the devil will lead men inevitably by this to deny the
plaineſt affirmations of God in the Scripture, as he was bold to tell
<hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>in dying ſhe ſhould not dye:</hi> the dying ſpoke
of, was not what ſhe thought of; it ſhould be but a dying to her preſent
dark ſtate of faith, and ſhe ſhould be as God, and live a more divine
life of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe: ſo will he (nay he doth) lead men upon this
principle to deny Chriſt the Lord that bought them, ſuggeſting to them,
that though the Scripture ſpeak of one Jeſus born of a woman at
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and dying neer <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for our ſins, and
that we ought to believe in him; yet the truth is, that is but a Fable, a
ſhadow, and type of ſome ſpiritual thing in us, which is the true Saviour
indeed of us. Nay, he upon this ground, teaches men peremptorily to deny that
there was ever ſuch a one as that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and that he is to be believed in;
and though men believe not in him, yet ſhall they not be damned, whatever the
Scripture ſeems to ſay to the contrary: And ſo for the Reſurrection of
the body, it leads to turn that into an Allegory; and to ſay, however the
Scripture ſeems to ſpeak of ſuch a thing, yet it but ſeems ſo; for
its to be underſtood only of a reſurrection of the <pb n="138" facs="tcp:152283:80"/>Spirit out of a ſad and dark condition into a ſtate of light and
gladneſs: Nay, the very Being of God and our walking towards him, the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, reproofs, and precepts of Grace muſt at length be ſo
looked upon too as but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: for I have met with ſuch as have not
ſticked raſhly to affirm, that no line in Scripture but hath its
ſpiritual meaning diſtinct from what the letter ſpeaks; which is the way
to deny the true God and his Worſhip; yea, to make nothing of corporal
adultery, fornication, theft, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whatever evil the letter of
Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth: ſo that this will lead a man to be like a wild horſe
in a fenceleſs Paſture, to run whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan ſhall delude his fancy, and
ſtir up his luſt to lead him.</p>
               <p>Therefore beware my Brethren of this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and of thoſe
that ſhall intice you to fall thereinto by ſleighting the open ſenſe of
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, and indeavoring to draw you from it too: Take the
Apoſtles directions; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of the Prophets &amp; the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Apoſtles of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.
ſo look for the Spirits opening the mind of God, as to hold to the words
which he hath declared himſelf in, and think not that he will declare
himſelf to thee in any ſuch new form, as to evacuate and make a fable of
what he hath fore-declared. God raiſed up, and gave to his Church Prophets
and Apoſtles (as was <pb n="139" facs="tcp:152283:80"/>noted above) to declare his minde,
and leave his Doctrine ſo to the Church, as that we might not be toſſed
too and fro with every winde of doctrine: But how ſhould their
Diſpenſations of their Knowledge of Chriſt as left to us by them, be
uſefull to keep us from ſuch toſſings, if they have given an uncertain
found, and left their Writings like a Weather-Cock, to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this way or
that with every winde; if they have given us h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dden expreſſions and left them at liberty to be interpreted by
whatever other ſpirit can declare to us another myſtery then what they
ſeem therein to have delivered?</p>
               <p>Dear ſouls, let us take heed to what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our
inſtruction: If the touchſtone given us be made uncertain, what are we
better in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mettals? if the Compaſs given us to ſay by fail or be
uncertain, how ſhall we ſteer aright by it to our deſired Haven? Suffer
not we our ſelves then to be baffled out and ſpoiled by Satan and his
inſtruments in this matter; remember it was the written Word; and in the
ſenſe that the words ſeem to hold forth withour wreſting, ſtraining
or allegorizing with which Chriſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Satan in his temptations, learn
we to do ſo alſo if we will go on ſafely and not be cheated of the
inheritance. As for that objection of ſome (as of <hi>T. C.</hi>) that the
Scriptures have come through the hands of Papiſts, and therefore probably
they may be corrupted; its a very weak one as <pb n="140" facs="tcp:152283:81"/>concerning
the Original Languages in which they were firſt written; for neither have
they only had the keeping of them, but thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and old
Teſtament the Jews have alſo, and both them and thoſe of the New
Teſtament the Witneſſes againſt them and their evils have had in all
Ages, as alſo the Greek Churches not all ſubject to the Pope and his
Faction; and yet thoſe Copies they have, in nothing of weight, if at all,
differ from the Copies in the Latine Churches: nor is there any probability,
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath corrupted them; not only becauſe they
could not do it, but others of other Churches, yea, ſo many as were faithful
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt its errors within it ſelf, muſt needs detect her
falſhood and cry ſhame of her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe then they would have
corrupted them in thoſe places which reprove and detect her own errors:
Verily, if they ever dared to corrupt them, they were very fools to leave
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched the places that make againſt their own errors; yea, and yet more,
if they would corrupt them to ſpeak againſt their errors, if ever they
ſpake otherwiſe more conformably to them; for there as they keep them (in
their original langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) we find teſtimony born againſt all their
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as againſt the Lordly dominion aſſumed by the Pope, againſt
their adoration of Images, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints and Angels, Purgatory,
Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works, and what not? ſo that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152283:81"/>of the Scriptures to witneſs againſt their
corruptions, is a notable argument of Gods care of them, and that they are not
corrupted by them; for if they had corrupted them, they would undoubtedly have
done it in thoſe things in which they make againſt them: But no more to
that.</p>
               <p>Let none of thoſe vain aſſaults of Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with
you, to let go the Sword of the Spirit, the Record of God in the Scriptures,
with which ye ſhould oppoſe him; but the more he indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it, the more
faſt hold it, and the more cloſely cleave unto them; mind we that of
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it,</hi>
Pſal. 119.140. and that <hi>ver.</hi> 126, 127. <hi>It is time for thee Lord
to work. for they have made void thy Law; therefore I love thy Commandments
above gold, yea above fine gold;</hi> the more men ſlight the Scriptures, the
more mind we them, and cleave we to them: there can be no greater folly then
for a man to throw away his weapon, becauſe his enemy deſires to have it
wreſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that he might the better harm him.</p>

Scriptures more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſtick to them more cloſely, then therefore
to neglect them; it being certain that no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains in it any error;
but men do err in their collections from it; and that is certainly an error
that contradicts the ſayings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So we find that when Satan
himſelf, the father of Hereſies, ſet upon Chriſt with Scripture, <hi>It
is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt did not
thereupon betake him to ſome other weapons, and let go the Scripture, but by
cleaving to it repell'd his temptation from the abuſe of Scripture: indeed
here it becomes us to have our ſenſes more exerciſed, that we may
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry their deceits, and diſcover their pervertings of the Scriptures; of
which thing alſo I deſire you to be careful, that they may not ſeem to
beat you with your own weapons; for even they that make no account of the
Scriptures, will catch at here and there a ſaying, and wreſt it againſt
the truth delivered in Scripture: ſo I have met with ſome (to give thee
ſome inſtances hereof, and indeavour thy help herein) who againſt that in
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for All, have
alledged that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.10.11. That the ranſomed of the Lord
ſhall return and come to <hi>Sion</hi> with ſinging; and thence argued that
Chriſt gave not himſelf a ranſome for All, <pb n="143" facs="tcp:152283:82"/>becauſe
all ſhall not do ſo; inſinuating a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion directly contradictory

neither can they die any more, but are equal to the Angels, and are the
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, &amp;c.</hi> And ſuch places are to be cleared to be both
true by diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the things ſpoken of in them; for they
ſpeak not <hi>(ad idem)</hi> or to the ſame thing, though 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152283:83"/>they uſe the ſame kinde of word in either of them: as
for example, That phraſe, The Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord in <hi>Iſai.</hi>
51.11. is not ſo general as that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 6. nor doth it reach to
all that at any time, or in any way are redeemed by him; for he redeemed
<hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet all thence redeemed or
ranſomed went not to <hi>Sion,</hi> nor ſhall have everlaſting joy and
gladneſs; for many of them were unbelievers. The ranſomed of the Lord in
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 51. are the ſtock of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.
ver.</hi> 2. that are gone into great bondage, and ſhall be brought out again
by the hand of the Lord awakned and putting forth its ſtrength and power, as
in the dayes of old when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> it ſpeaks of
a redeeming by power and ſtrong hand, and a ſetting free from the yoke of
oppreſſion that lay upon them from men; and it may be applied further to
thoſe that by the like putting forth of glorious power and ſpirit are
brought out from under thraldom to corruption and Satan, and from
Antichriſtian ſlavery, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.4. <hi>That are redeemed
from the earth</hi> (freed by the efficacy of the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt
in their conſciences from earthly affections) <hi>and from men,</hi> (that is
from their tyrannizing over them, or they being tied and bound up to men for
ſomething in them as men, to admire, ſerve, and take up their faith and
worſhip by the wills of them;) ſuch ſhall go to <hi>Sion</hi> and ſing
the ſong <pb n="145" facs="tcp:152283:83"/>of the Lamb too; but that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2.6. where its ſaid, Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for all, is ſpoken
of as a thing done in Chriſt, and not upon, or in men, a thing to be
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to men, even to the Declaration of which to all Nations (to the
utmoſt of his power) <hi>Paul</hi> was ordained, that in hearing and
believing the goodneſs of God in Chriſt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them, they might
ſubmit to God and Chriſt, and receive that further opening of his Love and
Truth to them, in and by which he might ſet them free; and in that fore
mentioned way of power redeem them: This ſpeaks of a ranſoming by price,
and bringing them into ſuch a freedom from the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fore-paſt upon all in <hi>Adam.</hi> that Chriſt (that notwithſtanding)
may ſhew what favor he ſees good to them, afford his bounty, patience, and
Goſpel to them as he pleaſeth, to lead them to repentance, and upon their
turning further love them. In like manner others deal with the precedent
<hi>verſe</hi> of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>viz. There is one Mediator between
God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> for endeavouring to diſprove that
we are to look to God by Chriſt as a Mediator; or that the Man Chriſt is
Mediator of God and men, they produce and oppoſe to it, that in <hi>Gal.</hi>
3.20. <hi>That a Mediator is not of one, but God is one;</hi> therefore, ſay
they, Chriſt is not a Mediator of <pb n="146" facs="tcp:152283:84"/>God, as is affirmed, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and if not of God, then not of God and man, as is there
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed alſo.</p>
               <p>But in the ſame manner, as before, art thou to defend thy
ſelf againſt this arguing alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> hold faſt the Divine
teſtimony, though thou knoweſt not how to anſwer them, and know that they
deal fallaciouſly with thee, though thou canſt not perhaps ſo plainly
tell wherein the fallacy lies with which he would enſnare thee; that they
oppoſe as contradictory thoſe things that are not ſo, but very
conſiſtent; for whereas. the Apoſtle in the <hi>Galathians</hi> ſaith,
<hi>That a Mediator is not of one, but God is one;</hi> that is, of one mind in
both adminiſtrations of Law and Goſpel, and needs none to reconcile
himſelf to himſelf in his giving of them; That of the ſame Apoſtle in
<hi>Timothy</hi> rather confirms it then denies it; for there is a mediation
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded not of one alone (as is the force of the Word <hi>One</hi> in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.) but of two diſtinct parties, not as yet fully and
compleatly reconciled to each other, God and man, in which the Man Chriſt
Jeſus is affirmed to be imployed as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of them; ſo that theſe two
are both true in their very expreſs ſayings, and neither of them
contradicent to other.</p>
               <p>Again, Others to prove that Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwiſe
born, crucified, dead, or raiſed, <pb n="147" facs="tcp:152283:84"/>then he is now dayly
in the hearts of men, and as he was ever from the beginning; as alſo that
there ſhall be no other Reſurrection or coming of Chriſt, then is now in,
and to men in their ſpirits, and always hath been, they bring that of
<hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That which hath been, that alſo ſhall
be, and what hath been done, that ſhall be done, and there is not any new
thing under the Sun.</hi> And that in Chap. 3. <hi>What hath been, the ſame
is now, and what ſhall be now, hath been, and God will require that which is
driven away.</hi> Their miſtake and abuſe of which is eaſily diſcerned,
if we hold faſt to the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt in other places, which
contradict their inferences from it; and if we alſo minde the ſcope of the
Preacher, &amp; whereabout he ſpeaketh, <hi>viz.</hi> that his ſpeech is
about the vanity and vexation of ſpirit, that is in (&amp; accrues to men
from) worldly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things and actions, things <hi>(ſub ſole)</hi> under
the Sun, or under the Government of it; and then his meaning is plain, that
there is a conſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the nature of natural things at all times; the
ſame ſpecies and properties in thoſe ſpecies, not the ſame
individuals, except they will affirm that they themſelves have been men and
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, born, nurſed up, and lived in the world in times paſt, even in
<hi>Solomons</hi> time, or in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world as well as now: and
if ſo, I would they would call to mind what they ſaw <pb n="148" facs="tcp:152283:85"/>done then, and help to perfect the Hiſtory of the world; but thats
evidently falſe; <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> are not now living
under the Sun, but the ſame kinds of things there are, men now as then, and
ſin and vanity in them now as then, trees and plants, &amp;c. and the ſame
common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of creatures now as then; the ſame weakneſs, vanity,
wickedneſs, and vexatiouſneſs now as before; and in that regard there is
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, no alteration of the nature of things under the Sun in their
natural actions and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But this is horribly beſides the
buſineſs of <hi>Solomons</hi> diſcourſe, to ſay the earth upon which
the trees and plants now grow, is as well void and without form now as it was
in the firſt day of its creation; and yet more, to ſay Chriſt hath come
no otherwiſe in the fleſh then he did in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> time, nor
ſuffered otherwiſe then there he had done; or that there ſhall be no
other riſing from the dead then was then, or viſible coming of Chriſt in
Glory and to Judgement: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe are things <hi>ſuper
ſolem,</hi> above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Sun. Beſide, neither ſays he,
<hi>there ſhall be no new thing;</hi> but he ſpeaks in the preſent time
in which he lived, there is no new thing. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> that
lived after him, ſays, <hi>The Lord will create a new thing in the earth, a
woman ſhall compaſs a man, Jer.</hi> 31.22. and ſure that was in its time
a new thing, that a Virgin <pb n="149" facs="tcp:152283:85"/>conceived and brought forth
without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any man; yea God hath ſaid that <hi>He will make all
things new;</hi> and therefore its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that their enlarging of the
Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its ſcope and expreſſion is very falſe and groſs;
yea, that they are of the number of thoſe men that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks
of, The <hi>mockers that ſhould ſay, Where is the promiſe of his
coming?</hi> (that is in effect, He ſhall never come again) <hi>for ſince
the Fathers fell aſleep all things continue in like ſtate.</hi> Yea, yet
further, we may retort this Scripture upon themſelves as to their denial of
the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous coming of Chriſt, and his raiſing up the dead bodies of men
departed, that being rather here affirmed; for if that that is ſhall be, and
God requires that that is paſt or driven away, then that body of theirs that
is ſhall be; and that Chriſt that was on the earth ſhall be again; and
though their bodies that are dead, and are, as it were, driven away, yet God
will require them again, and judge them for what is paſt, and what men have
violently thruſt or driven away. But this is a ſafe Rule for thee to go by,
that no Scripture is rightly interpreted, when its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted point blank
contradictory to the ſayings of other Scriptures about thoſe things
whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are interpreted. Like to their abuſes of theſe and other
places, is that, that they quote, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Wherefore if ye be
dead with Chriſt to <pb n="150" facs="tcp:152283:86"/>the rudiments of the world, why then
as living in the world are ye ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> to ſhew that they
are above the Ordinances of God, and need not regard them; whereas the
Apoſtle after explains himſelf to ſpeak of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Documents
of the world (for he adds, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commandments and Documents of
men,</hi> and that they have a <hi>ſhew of wiſdom in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip</hi>)
and not of the Ordinances of God, which who ſo is not ſubject to, is not
ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by whom and whoſe authority they are appointed: yea, the
Apoſtle himſelf commends that very people for their <hi>Order</hi> as well
as for their <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs in faith, ver.</hi> 5. and exhorts them to
admoniſh one another; and that in Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs,
and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in prayer and thankſgiving, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. and 4.2.
&amp;c. which are Ordinances of God; and therefore ſure he cannot rightly be
underſtood in the other place, to tax them for being ſubject to them; nay,
if that was a fault in them, then ſhould they not be ſubject to the
Apoſtles teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admonition, they being alſo Ordinances of Gods
appointing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. And to give but one inſtance more, They in
like manner, ſome of them abuſe that ſaying in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28.
<hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory;</hi> the meaning whereof is this, that
Chriſt, as he was made of a woman, and made under the Law, and as he died,
roſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, <pb n="151" facs="tcp:152283:86"/>is glorified, and appears in the
preſence of God for us eyed, minded, believed on, and underſtood, is that
that ſprings up in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, hope of future glory; whereas other
men, either have no hope of glory, or have their hope in other things; the
believers hope is in and from Chriſt, as he hath done ſuch great things for
him, and is made of God ſuch a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him; that I ſay, as its known,
believed, and minded, begets and maintains that hope in him. In which regard
alſo (<hi>viz.</hi> as he is in his Knowledge, Faith, Love, &amp;c.) he is
ſaid to be in him; as alſo in regard of his Spirit or Divine Vertue and
Power in, and through that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith working in him. But this, I
ſay, ſome abuſe to this end, to perſwade men that Chriſt is no
otherwiſe exiſtent but in the hearts of men, hath no real ſpiritual
glorified body in the heavens, which is a meer ſtrained and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
collection; for if that were ſo, he ſhould be rather the fruition of glory
in them, then the hope of it onely; for the fruition of glory is in the
believers having Chriſt really and perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſtent with him, 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. And ſurely when Chriſt ſhall <hi>deſcend from
heaven, and take up the dead Saints, being firſt raiſed, to be ever with
him,</hi> he ſhall not <hi>deſcend</hi> or come out of his peoples hearts,
and leave them in regard of his nhabitation of them; nor needed
<hi>Stephen</hi> ſo <pb n="152" facs="tcp:152283:87"/>ſtedfaſtly to have looked up
into heaven, to have ſeen him in his heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55. nor would
there have been any ſuch glorious appearance of him unto <hi>Paul,</hi> as
cauſed a bright ſhining, viſible to the ſtanders by, if he had had no
other being or exiſtence then in the hearts of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.7. and
22.9.</p>
               <p>Such inferences then are meer abuſes of Scripture, not
aſſerted in, but contradictory to the Scriptures: by keeping cloſe to
which (as was before noted) thou maiſt deſcry them to be vain, as Chriſt
holding cloſe to the Scriptures, detected Satans abuſe of Scripture to him.
Beware I ſay then of their falſe Collections, and ſtrained inferences
againſt the ſtream of the Scriptures, and contrary to their plain
ſayings; and their errings from the faith once delivered to the Saints, as
they are by the Scriptures made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be errings therefrom, contend
againſt; but yet this their practiſe notwithſtanding, or their allegation
of Hereticks in general abuſing and diverſly wreſting them, do not thou
ſlight them, but the more to minde them, they being as the Apoſtle tells
us, ſufficient to make the man of God perfect, even fully able alſo to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and reprove ſuch abuſive perverſions of them; yea and in, and
through faith in Chriſt, to guide and keep thee, and make thee uſeful to

that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein; yet as they are written, ſo that writing is but
a medium to make over thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelations by; and the writing it ſelf
is not the thing that hath life in it; but the things witneſſed to, and
ſpoken of in them; which things are not the object of the natural eye that
looks upon the outward writing; nor is the glory and certainty of thoſe
things diſcernable to the natural underſtanding, unleſs the
Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be opened; though Truth in true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions be
preſented to it, yet it will not ſee them in the luſtre, beauty,
certainty, glory, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of them; nor will it minde the love, grace,
wiſdom, and glory of God therein ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſo the heart will not be
rightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to them, nor able to hold them faſt, ſo as nothing
ſeparate or withdraw it from them; <pb n="154" facs="tcp:152283:88"/>nor can, or ſhal we
ſo make uſe of them, as not to be over-reached by Satan, or have them in
readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when we ſhould have moſt uſe of them, uneſs they be put
into us by the finger of God ingraven in our hearts, and dwell in us, being
underſtood, believed, loved, delighted in by us; though the word therein
declared be a ſpiritual Sword, fit to fight the Lords battel with, yet we
have need of God to teach our hands to war, and our fingers to fight with, and
to make it powerful and effectual againſt our ſpiritual enemies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom we draw it. Now the Lord hath promiſed to ſend his Spirit, to the end
to bring his Words to our remembrance, to teach us, lead us into all truth,
help our infimities, &amp;c. And he is a Spirit of Wiſdom and
Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Spirit of Might and Power, and of the fear of the Lord, a
ſpirit of Truth and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in whoſe might and wiſdom, and not in
our own, if we encounter Satan and his meſſengers, we ſhall overcome
them; but as he is in the hand of the Lord to ſend forth, yea, is his hand;
ſo hath he told us, that he would be ſought to by us, to perform for us the
things that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth us; and ſo for this his Spirit to give wiſdom
and underſtanding to us. Thence we are to look to him alſo in <hi>prayer
and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with thanſgivings</hi> for what he gives us; according
to that <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6,7. <hi>In nothing be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="155" facs="tcp:152283:88"/>or thoughtful</hi> (as to ſay and reaſon with our ſelves, how
ſhall we finde out truth, how ſhall we eſcape the wiles of Satan?)
<hi>but in all things or caſes make known your requeſts unto God by

oftentimes may come in and deceive us.</p>
               <p>It is true, that God doth often prevent us with his goodneſs,
and is found of them that ſeek him not; yea, that alſo is neceſſary to
our ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; for if he did not firſt give to us a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our
wants, and of his goodneſs, how ſhould we call upon him? but its as true,
that he having ſo prevented us, and freely made known himſelf to us, he
expects this fruit again from us, that we be thankful to him, and follow on to
know him, ſeeking for further help, and mercy of him. So he could have given
us bleſſing, ſpirit, knowledge, &amp;c. immediatly into our ſelves; but
having found us unfaithful in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to have plaid the Prodigals,
he hath in his wiſdom, choſen rather to depoſitate them in Jeſus
Chriſt, willing us to repair to him, &amp; to God by him for them, to be
given us out according to our needs, which he alſo hath promiſed we ſhall
receive, <pb n="157" facs="tcp:152283:89"/>ſo coming to him: but if we turn our backs upon
him, and ſhall ſtoutly and proudly lift up our ſelves, and ſay,
<hi>Tuſh, we are Lords, we will come no more at thee, Jer.</hi> 2.31. we need
not call upon God for any thing, for all things are ours, <hi>and what profit
is it if we pray to him,</hi> (as wicked men are noted to ſay, <hi>Job</hi>
21.15.) ſeeing God is engaged to us by his Promiſe, or we ſhall have what
is appointed for us? If I ſay we ſhall thus reaſon, however we may (as
others guilty of the like pride before us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16) be called happy
by others; yet ſurely God will reſiſt us, and we are in danger to be
given up to Satan, and to our own hearts, till they have brought us to
confuſion: The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> plainly tels ſome, that they
<hi>received not, becauſe they asked not,</hi> or becauſe <hi>they asked
amiſs, to conſume it on their own luſts, James</hi> 4.3. And our Saviour

God when no ſound is heard, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. or
with the mouth alſo, as <hi>David</hi> and Chriſt, and the Saints of God in
their ſeveral ages uſed moſt commonly to do. Its true, that God looks at
the heart more then at the words in prayer; but yet he regards thoſe
petitions that are poured out in the Spirit, and in the name of Chriſt in a
ſingle heart that are vocally expreſt; and they are not to be heard or
regarded that contemn praying with words, and make a tuſh thereof, though in
the mean time they pretend that they pray alwayes, in that they are content
with what God doth to them, or now and then wiſh this or that to be done to
themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: I fear ſuch, under pretence of praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
pray not at all, or very ſeldom, and are rather of thoſe deſpiſers of
Ordinances in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. that ſay, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God,
and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances? &amp;c.</hi> ſurely
Chriſt taught his Diſciples to utter words, though he told them too, that
he would not have them vain, in thinking to be heard for their much ſpeaking;
yea verily, not onely <hi>David, Solomon, Moſes, Samuel, Daniel,</hi> and all
the <pb n="160" facs="tcp:152283:91"/>antient Worthies uttered words ſolemnly in prayer
unto God, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo at ſeveral ſeaſons:
ſurely he needed not to have ſeparated himſelf into a ſolitary place
apart to pray, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.23. if to pray had been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buſineſs then many make of it; or if he had thought it needleſs to pray.
When he was to leave his Diſciples, he prayed with his voyce too, and uttered
many ſweet and pretious words, which are recorded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. And ſo
the Diſciples after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in an
upper Chamber in prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. And after the Holy Ghoſt was poured
upon them, they were not of this Opinion of theſe proud ſpirits, that think
they need pray no more, they have all already: but they continued in prayer
ſtill, and uttered words too therein, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. and 4.24. and 6.4.
<hi>We will give our ſelves,</hi> ſay they, <hi>continually to prayer,
&amp;c.</hi> So when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon they were met to pray,
<hi>Acts</hi> 12. they could not paſs away their time ſo jovially as ſome
that pretend to know Chriſt as well or better, in laughing and ſporting,
carding and gaming, &amp;c. but they ſpent their time (when they met) in
prayer, and God heard them too. Yea <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, one of the prime

the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> kneeled down and prayed with them,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20.36. to which alſo ſometimes they added Faſting. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then they that deſpiſe this Ordinance, or that think they do it
ſufficiently by now and then perhaps an ejaculation of a deſire,
deſpiſing to pray together ſolemnly as occaſion is offered, are
ſcarcely led by the ſame ſpirit that led the Apoſtles and ancient
Saints of God; and they neglect one part of the ſpiritual armor provided for
them, and in that plat lay themſelves open to Satans temptations: yea ſure,
they that are above Ordinances, are alſo above this ſpiritual armor, at
leaſt in ſome parts of it; and when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath got them thither, he hath
advantage enough againſt them; for now he finds them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and can as he
liſts captivate and wound them. To be ſure, they pray not with all prayer
and ſupplication: but by the Prophets verdict of ſuch, they are proud and
high-conceited, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſwelling words of vanity; and becauſe
they are ſenſual, they judge of Gods Word and Ordinances according to
ſenſe, counting Gods Ordinances low and fooliſh things, &amp; preferring
their own wiſdom and ways before them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. I wiſh there be
not too great an increaſe of this proud and ſenſual generation; and that
it were not too common for people to count ſuch happy, though they have
deſpiſed the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity <pb n="162" facs="tcp:152283:92"/>of Gods Wayes appointed for
their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But, ye beloved, beware of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits as ſuch are
led with; and keep ye cloſe to God, in making known your requeſts dayly and
(as the Apoſtle exhorts) in every ſeaſon, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, that ye
may find the leadings of the Spirit and Grace of God with you therein, and know
what to ask of him, and that ye may hear what anſwers God will again return

them, and that they may receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance promiſed them. Having then
ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, faithful promiſes, and every way great incouragements,

hearkens to, and hears and ſets down in his book of Remembrance;</hi>
according to that of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 4 9. <hi>Two are better then
one, becauſe they have a good reward for their labour; and if they fall, the
one will lift up his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth; for
he hath not another to lift him;</hi> Such a one is both more eaſily
overturned and thrown down, and being gone, is the leſs recoverable. Again,
<hi>If two lie together they may have heat; but how can one be warm alone?</hi>
In Chriſtian Communion and abiding together in the fellowſhip of the
Goſpel, there is ſpiritual heat and fervor; one whets up and provoketh
another to love and good works, of which the forſakeing of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
depriveth a man: yea, <hi>if one prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, two ſhall
withſtand him.</hi> One may watch over another in Chriſtian Communion, 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152283:95"/>yea <hi>and a threefold cord is not eaſily broken:</hi>
where two or three are gathered together in the Name of Chriſt, there he
comes in and twiſts them faſter in his Spirit, ſo that unleſs by
untwining them they are not eaſily broken.</p>
               <p>Take we heed then to watch over one another, and frequent Gods
Ordinances together. And indeed God hath appointed ſuch Ordinances as will
put us upon mutual walking together, as exhorting one another, joint prayers in
the Name of Chriſt, breaking of bread, &amp;c. ſo that we muſt
deſpiſe and kick againſt Gods Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty if we will not walk in the faith
together: yea he hath ſo meaſured out his Gifts and Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his
Saints that none might ſay to other, I have no need of thee, and that we may
not attain to comprehend the depth, length, heighth, and breadth, and know the
love of God that paſſeth knowledge but in unity with all Saints,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17,18. Deſpiſe not Propheſying then, nor forſake
not the aſſemblies of your ſelves, but build up your ſelves in your
moſt holy faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt, walking in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking one
another to love and good works, firmly believing his Promiſe of bleſſing,
who hath ſaid, <hi>In every place where I record my Name, I will come to
thee, and I will bleſs thee, Exod.</hi> 20.24.: And again, <hi>Bleſſed is
he that heareth my words, and watcheth daily at the poſts of my gates; 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152283:96"/>for he that findeth me findeth life, &amp;c. Prov.</hi>
8.33. And <hi>where brethren dwell together in unity, there God commandeth his

to make choice and uſe of the weak things of the world to be the mediums of

thee that they for their parts are got into a higher Form, or to be under a
more glorious diſpenſation above all Forms or Ordinances, ſo as that they
are of nouſe or profit to them; ſo that God is throwing them down, or hath
caſt them by; and its a far happier and higher ſtate to be, and live above
them then under them: ſo intiſing thee from attendance to God in them,
&amp; to aſpire, <hi>Eve</hi>-like to that better and higher condition; but
therein they play the Serpent with thee, and therefore beware of them. Indeed
there are Ordinances that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not under, <hi>viz.</hi> the
ordinances of mans invention in the worſhip of God (for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we are
to be ſubject to the civil Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of man for the Lords ſake, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) ſuch as <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle not, &amp;c.
according to the traditions &amp; commandements of men, Col.</hi> 2.22. as
alſo the Ordinances of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Jewiſh
obſervations Chriſt hath freed us from; but of theſe is not the
queſtion; but of the Ordinances of the Lord, even of the Lord Jeſus, ſuch
as Preaching, Hearing, Prayer, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the Supper of the Lord, &amp;c.
Concerning which alſo thats not to be denied, that they are not the matter we
are to live upon, the meat we are to feed on: The Lord Jeſus himſelf, as he
is <pb n="172" facs="tcp:152283:97"/>the great Witneſs of the love of God to us, and the
Revealer of his minde, is the true Lord of heaven, and thoſe Ordinances are
but as diſhes in which that food is preſented, or the way in which we are
to ſeek and look for it: for men to live upon their acts about, and
attendence to them then, is to idolize them, or lift them into an higher place
then God hath appointed them, and to make a Chriſt of them, neglecting and
miſſing Chriſt himſelf, the life and fulneſs of them. And ſuch an
abuſe of them, or of our ſelves in them, is as far from pleaſing God, as
the ſetting up devices of our own, as is to be ſeen <hi>Iai.</hi> 66.3,4.
from reſting in the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without, or with denial of the power
of it men are to be taken: and did theſe men ſay no more, they were to be
commended therein; but when they take advantage from this truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of taking men off from reſting in Forms, to withdraw them from the
Ordinances themſelves, as if they are to look after a power without a form
therein, they do fooliſhly, being deceived, and deceiving; therein they ſet
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Lord Jeſus, who commanded them; yea exalt
themſelves above him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God in him: Even as they that throw by the
Acts and Ordinances of Parliament, though never ſo lawfully convened, and
pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be above them, do therein throw by 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152283:97"/>their Authority, and ſet themſelves above it: and
ſure they that do ſo with Chriſt, do deny the Lord that bought them, and
exalt themſelves with the man of Sin, above all thats called God, or that is
worſhipped; as if God and Chriſt had no authority or power to bind them.
Perhaps they will tell thee, that as ſome perſons may not be concerned in
ſome Acts of Parliament, and ſo they may be above it, becauſe it doth not
reach them; and all Laws or Acts, though of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet when repealed,
men are not under them, and yet no lifting up mens ſelves againſt, or above
the power that made them; ſo there are ſome perſons who are above thoſe
Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, becauſe he did not intend them for them, or to be of
any binding force to them; or, that though they have been in force, yet now
their date is expited, he hath diſannulled them. To the former part of this
objection agree thoſe ſayings of ſome, that they are under a higher
adminiſtration; time was when they were under them, and found uſe of them;
but now they are ſo no longer; they are uſeful for Novices: but when
Chriſt hath given his Spirit unto men, and ſo they have him, they have no
more need or uſe of them. To the former agrees that conceit, that as the Laws
of <hi>Moſes</hi> were in force ſome time till the coming of Chriſt in
the fleſh, but after that, gave place to him, and God then changed 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152283:98"/>his adminiſtration; ſo the Ordinances of Chriſt were
in force ſo long as Chriſt was in the fleſh; but when the Spirit of
Chriſt was given, or Chriſt laid aſide his fleſh, and came in Spirit,
then no more uſe or need of them. The latter of which contains notable
deceits and falſehoods; for neither did the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ceaſe
to be of force when Chriſt came in the fleſh, but was in force till after
his Reſurrection, untill the pouring out of the Spirit, or his coming in
Spirit, as they call it, though the Ordinances of Chriſt were inſtituted
before that time alſo; nor did Chriſt put off, or lay away his fleſh, but
raiſed it again, that the word of Propheſie might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, that
ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi>
which the Apoſtle <hi>Petrr</hi> tells us was fulfilled in that That <hi>the
fleſh of Chriſt ſaw no corruption, Acts</hi> 2.31. Though he laid aſide
his weakneſs and form of a ſervant, yet not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his body,
which he ſhewed to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to have fleſh and bones in it after his
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and in which he aſcended, filling it with the glory of God,
as before it had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mans low condition. Beſides, Chriſt
poured out his Spirit upon his Diſciples, to that end that they might teach
and ſubject the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Inſtitutions; and they were ſo far from
expiring then, that then was the beginning of their impouring. Plain it is that
our Saviours <pb n="175" facs="tcp:152283:98"/>Commiſſion (in which he injoyns, and
authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Diſciples <hi>to diſciple the Gentiles</hi> (or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<hi>Baptiſing them, and teaching them to obſerve all things that he had
commanded them,</hi>) <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. did both begin then to take place,
when the fleſh or body of Chriſt being taking up from them, the Spirit was
poured out upon them (for till then they were to (and did) tarry at
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in expectation of the promiſe of the Spirit to fit them
for the works of their Commiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4.) and the Ordinances
therein ſpoken of were ordered to be in force to the worlds end; for ſo
long as he expreſly tels them they ſhould have his aſſiſtance, and
ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preſence in the work of their Commiſſion; <hi>And ſo I am
with you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the end of the world:</hi> And the Supper of
the Lord is ſaid to be for <hi>ſhewing forth of the Lords Death till be
come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. for which coming the Church prayeth; and
therefore ſurely is ſo to pray till
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e come. But here ſome have
another glorious, but deceitful evaſion; for granting that they are of force
till the end of the world, &amp; till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; they reply, To
us he is come, and with us the world is at an end; we are already in
poſſeſſion of him, raiſed, judged, and in heaven: And here ſeems to
be the heighth, and ſtrength of deluſion: and this is that with which they
ſtrengthen the former part of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <pb n="176" facs="tcp:152283:99"/>objection, namely, That they are attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a heigher
adminiſtration then to be under them.</p>
               <p>To diſcover their deluſion in which, let this firſt be
premiſed, that theſe expreſſions are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a double
underſtanding: the one more inward and ſpiritual, and as a firſt fruits
of or earneſt of the other: a coming of Chriſt in the power of the Spirit
to the ſoul, raiſing it up in the knowledge of himſelf, and God in him,
from its ſpiritual death in ſin to a ſpiritual life, the life of God,
juſtifying of it, and giving it an eſcape from condemnation, taking it out
of the ſtate of the world, and deading it in its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and affections
to the world, and the world to it. And here Chriſt is to and in the ſoul
its life and hope of glory, and ſets it in heavenly ſtate with himſelf in
regard of hope, and ſome experience of the powers of heaven: And this is a
thing that comes now to one ſoul, now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as men are brought in to
depend on him. But now there is another ſenſe of thoſe phraſes, and
that moſt uſual in Scripture, namely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the great Day of the Lord,
the coming of Chriſt in glory and power, bringing all his Saints with him,
executing vengeance upon all that have done ungodlily, and fully freeing not
onely the ſpirits of the Saints from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a firſt fruits, but
their bodies alſo from <pb n="177" facs="tcp:152283:99"/>death and corruption, which is
called <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our bodies,</hi> Rom 8.23. <hi>When every eye
ſhall ſee him, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 1.7. When <hi>all that are in their graves
ſhall come forth, ſome to the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life, others to the
reſurrection of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 5.29. When <hi>all the
Saints toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and be for
ever with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16,17.</p>
               <p>Now as theſe men deny this his glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming,
turning all, ſo well as their wits will ſerve them and their Father help
them, into an Allegory; ſo in theſe two things they groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In thinking that perſons to whom Chriſt hath come
by his Spirit, and whom he hath raiſed and quickned up to a lively hope, as
in the firſt ſenſe, are thereby above Ordinances, and not bound to attend
them; for indeed then are they fitteſt to uſe them, and will be moſt
profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or profited in attending on God in them. Beſides, we finde the
Apoſtles and other Primitive Believers of another way and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: when
the Spirit was poured upon <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> and his houſhold, that
exempted them not from the outward Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. nor were the
Apoſtles themſelves exempted from ſolemn prayers and faſting, breaking
of bread, Preaching the VVord, &amp;c. even after the holy Ghoſt was poured
upon them, and Chriſt by his <pb n="178" facs="tcp:152283:100"/>Spirit dwelt with them, as
is plain in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24,31. and 6.4,6. and 13.1,3. and 14.23. yea,
<hi>Wo to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (even after the holy Ghoſt was
ſhed abundantly upon him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3 6.) <hi>if I preach not the
Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. and <hi>the Bread</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we
break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> and <hi>the Cup
that we bleſs, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor.
10.16. yea, in 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>We are all baptized</hi> (ſaith he)

juſtified, ſanctified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit
of God;</hi> but what, were they all above Ordinances therefore, &amp; no
matter for obſerving them? No ſuch matter, but they are yet ordered about
their eating the Lords Supper; yea, and ſuch as whoſe election in the
ſanctification of the Spirit is affirmed, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by the Apoſtles to

<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13,39,40. They are lyers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts then that tell
thee they have thoſe things already, when as many of the Saints, or ſuch as
ſhall be ſo, are yet dead in their ſpirits; yea dead in ſin. Its true,
at that great appearing of the Lord, Gifts ſhall ceaſe, and Tongues, and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, nor ſhall any man need in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſay to one
another know the Lord, for all the ſubjects of it ſhall then know him, when
we are all come together, in the unity of the faith, and in the acknowledgement
of the Son of God unto a perfect man; but till that time, as we have clay
tabernacles, bodies of fleſh for our ſpirits to inhabit in, ſo ſhall we
need outward mediums for our helpfulneſs, ſuited to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and
Chriſt being aſcended, hath alſo <pb n="183" facs="tcp:152283:102"/>given gifts unto
men, and appointed the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his holy Apoſtles and Prophets,
with the Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers to teach his Saints by, <hi>for
the work of the Miniſtry, for the perfecting of the Saints, and edifying of
the body of Chriſt,</hi> and to preſerve us from being <hi>blown away</hi>
from Chriſt <hi>by every Winde and blaſt of Doctrine,</hi> even untill that
time that we all come together, as is ſaid before, unto a perfect man.</p>
               <p>Hold thou theſe things faſt then, and be not ſhaken in
minde by any mans words or writing, or by ſpirit, as if that Day of the Lord
was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſome or other come; come in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time to them, or
in this time to theſe, as it muſt be, if there were any morning light in
theſe mens doctrine: Its to be feared rather, that theſe are introducing a
more notable Apoſtacy from Chriſt, that muſt precede, or go before that
his coming: See I pray thee, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1,2,3,4, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I might inſiſt upon that ſaying here, That the worlds at
an end in, and with them; for ſuch like expreſſions drop from ſome; but
I hope thats ſo evidently falſe to any in their right minds, in that they
yet live in the world, eat and drink, marry, and are given in marriage as other
men, yea follow the faſhions of the world too, in trimming up themſelves,
and ſeeking the riches, pleaſures, and fulneſs of the world, ſo as that

               <head>Sect. 10. Of Sobermindedneſs, and Humility.</head>
               <p>TAke heed alſo my Brethren, of thoſe evils before ſpoken
of, that lay open the ſoul to the power of Satan, and eſpecially of
ſpiritual pride, highmindedneſs and curioſity: think not of your
ſelves, becauſe of your parts, ſtrength, wiſdom, viſits, attainments,
above that is meet; nor lift up your ſelves by thoſe things that are given
you. There is an inſobriety, and ſpiritual pride, that many times men of
parts, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are prone to fall into, to over-wean their own abilities:
Did not <hi>Peter</hi> err that wayes, when he was confident, that though all
denied Chriſt, yet he would not? and we ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of that thought;
it made him preſume to put himſelf into the temptation more then the
reſt; and when he was tried, he proved as weak, or weaker then the reſt.
<hi>A haughty minde often goes before a fall,</hi> Pro. 16.18. Men proud of
their abilities, and puft up, as if they were ſome body in their attainments,
are nigh to falling; for <hi>he that lifteth up himſelf ſhall be abaſed,
but he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luke 14.11. 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152283:103"/>
                  <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. And yet how prone men of parts, or ſuch as attain to
much favour with God, are to be puft up, we may note in this, that when God had
rapt up <hi>Paul</hi> into the third heavens, he preſently after ſent him
<hi>a prick in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, that he
might not ſwell,</hi> in a fleſhly doting upon himſelf, <hi>for the
abundance of viſions and revelations given him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. Fleſh
hath an inclination in it to ſwell, even by occaſion of thoſe things that
God priviledges a man in by his Spirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it needs to be ſometime
taken down: <hi>Paul</hi> was not without ſome feeling of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could the better warn others of it, <hi>Not to be highminded, but to fear,</hi>
Rom. 11.20. eſpecially ſeeing our <hi>ſtanding is by faith,</hi> and
faith receives all from, and lives upon another, and not upon aſtock in a
mans ſelf: Its a vertue carrying the ſoul to lean wholly upon God in
Chriſt, his Wiſdom, Strength, Mercy, Truth, Faithfulneſs, and not upon
its own ſufficiency, parts, attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it ſelf, &amp;c. Now as he that
lives upon God, muſt needs live ſurely; ſo he that lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own
fulneſs, though he think it is God in himſelf he lives upon, muſt needs
live dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, becauſe upon an empty broken Ciſtern; there are no
perſons in greater danger to fall into the temptations of Satan then ſuch;
for <pb n="186" facs="tcp:152283:104"/>they that live on high in themſelves, are like the
drunkard on the top of a maſt; being drunken with a conceit of their own
ſufficiency, they reel and ſtagger too and fro, and fall down into the gulf
of error and wickedneſs; for by how much the more the heart exalteth and
prides it ſelf in its fulneſs, ſo much the leſs it mattereth to lean
upon Gods Word, and mind his Directions; and the leſs it mindeth Gods Word,
the more empty it is of the Strength and Wiſdom of the Spirit that therein
worketh, and ſo the more apt it is to cloſe with deluſions, eſpecially
with ſuch ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity and deceit as beſt ſuit with, and
nouriſh ſuch conceits of ſelf-fulneſs, pride and high thoughts of
ſelf, putting men upon bold preſumptuous adventures, as if they could fly
up into the heavens, and as if they had now no further need of Churches, or
Gods ſpiritual weapons; no further need of Praying, Hearing, Scriptures,
Conference, any thing; they are ready to dare the devil to tempt them, and
ſit looſe from Chriſt, as able to go on alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his mediation; but
alas, this is their folly; for leaving him, they are ſoon over-reacht by
Satan, who can eaſily hold them faſt, eſpecially when he hath perſwaded
them there is no ſuch thing as a Devil, or Satan.</p>
               <p>Take heed therefore of this, and of that other branch of
inſobriety that uſually accompanies it, <pb n="187" facs="tcp:152283:104"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
curioſity in our ſearchings and inquiſitions after knowledge, an
over-reaching of our ſelves to ſee into ſecrets, a peeping into the Ark,
<hi>a pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into things not ſeen, being vainly puft up with a fleſhly
mind,</hi> Col. 2.18. a thing that hath ever proved very dangerous and hurtful
to them that have been addicted thereto: what caught <hi>Eve</hi> at the
firſt, but a deſire to be as God, knowing good and evil? and what makes men
more to turn out from Chriſt, then a not being content with his ſimplicity,
but affecting vain Philoſophy, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, and by reaſon to
dive into things that are above our comprehenſions? whence elſe proceed
thoſe queſtions about the ſecret purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thoughts, and hidden
counſels of God, the curious inquiſitions into his Eſſence, and about
heaven, hell, the ſtate of ſouls departed, and many other curioſities
beyond what the VVord declareth of them; queſtions which we may comprehend
under thoſe that the Apoſtle ſays tend not to profit, but to pervert men,
and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them: he that walketh humbly, as knowing nothing but infirmity and
evil in himſelf, and contents himſelf with things revealed, receiving
ſuch Truths, ſo as to walk in them, and keep cloſe unto them, avoiding
nice and hidden ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, he walks ſurely, and ſhall be preſerved
from falling; when others that climb aloft, tumble down again: Take we
therefore the <pb n="188" facs="tcp:152283:105"/>counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant, for your adverſary the devil goeth
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout like a roaring lyon, ſeeking daily Whom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Whom reſiſt
ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> Keep cloſe to the Faith, and ſo to the Word
of God, the proper object of mans Faith; but take heed of an inſober prying
into things beſides it. Be not drunk (as not with pleaſures, cares, fears,
ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from things below, ſo neither) with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of our ſelves,
deſires of God-likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is held forth in the faith; nor with
deſires to know things that God hath reſerved to himſelf; neither yet be
ſecure and careleſs through conceit of thine own ſtrength and ſtanding,
nor raſh in cloſing with every hint, doctrine, or ſpirit that is
preſented to thee, but be ſober and vigilant; ſober in not out-running
Gods VVord and Spirit; vigilant in watching and examining every doctrine and
ſpirit, by comparing it with the holy Spirit, and his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Law in
his written VVord, and the holy Unction already through the Goſpel of
Chriſt received, leſt Satan over-reach thee, and finding thee out of the
bounds of Gods way, in which he hath ingaged his protection, devour thee.
Verily in theſe laſt times, its ſad to ſee how men ſtagger to and
fro, and reel up and down, wavering between this and that opinion like drunken
men, their hearts being ſurfeited, and <pb n="189" facs="tcp:152283:105"/>their heads made
giddy with conceits of their own excellencies and abilities, ſo that they
think themſelves able to ſwallow up all the moſt ſecret knowledge of
God himſelf into their fancies; but alas, with the Dog in the Fable, while
they catch at ſhadows, under deſire of having all knowledge, in ſtead of
attaining their deſires, they let go and loſe all that hath ſubſtance
in it; not comprehending things, they deny them; not comprehending heaven and
hell, the glory of Chriſts Humanity, &amp;c. they grow into
Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm and Atheiſm, and loſe themſelves in vanity.</p>
               <p>Of theſe things therefore be thou warned to avoid them, that
they ſnare thee not, and thou periſh in them: Take heed alſo of
ſlothfulneſs in ſeeking after, and unto God; formality, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
thy ſelf with ſpeculations of Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of it renewing the
heart; and ſo of preſumpcion, earthly-mindedneſs, and the reſt of the

Faith, quitting thy ſelf with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in all encounters, and thou ſhalt
prove it a good fight indeed, both for that its lawful, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and

               <p>THe heirs of the Promiſes of God, (even as the ſubjects of
the Election to the injoyment of them) is primarily Chriſt; and then
ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in and through him Saints by calling, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him.
That Chriſt is firſtly the Heir of the Promiſe, is clear from
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16,17. <hi>The Promiſe was to Abraham and his ſeed</hi> (to
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by vertue of his ſeed) he ſaith <hi>not unto ſeeds as
of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt:</hi> And again,
<hi>the Promiſe was fore-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of God unto Chriſt.</hi> He is the heir
of all things, and principally of the Promiſes of God, eſpecially thoſe
of eternal Life; as he is the Elect of God, choſen to be his holy One without
blame before him for ever, and the Son of his Love, the receptacle of the
fulneſs of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Secondly, As any are of God called, and by the
grace diſcovered and working in the Call brought unto, and into Chriſt;
ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be heirs in and with Chriſt, reckoned after Chriſt, as
in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27,28,29. <hi>So many as have been baptized into Chriſt,
have put on Chriſt; and if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and

                     </gap>irs according to Promiſe.
Abrahams</hi> ſeed, not <pb n="194" facs="tcp:152283:108"/>another, but one ſeed
ſtill, as in unity with Chriſt; <hi>for ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are all

Promiſes; but they that are born of the Spirit, and are in Chriſt Jeſus:
they, and they onely (not the Law neither, and its ſeed) are the choſen of
God to this great dignity, to be heirs of his Promiſes. Whence alſo it
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that men come to partake of, and to enjoy the Promiſes by Faith in
Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>In him all the Promiſes of God are yea and amen, to the
praiſe and glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. A man abiding and continuing in
him and his Word, ſhall meet with ſupply and proviſion here, ſo far as
God ſees good and needful for this life; ſupport alſo, and ſpirit from
God to inable him to the incounter, and to give him the victory, and ſhall
inherit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory. On the contrary, <hi>If any draw back, his ſoul
ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. He deprives himſelf
thereby of his own mercy: if any man throw down his weapons and yield to Satan,
neglecting himſelf of, or renouncing the Son of God to whom he was called,
and through whoſe bloud he was ſanctified, he puts himſelf out of the way
of the Promiſes: they are not to any <hi>Yea and Amen</hi> out of Chriſt,
but in him; nor to nay ſimply as men, but as men in <pb n="195" facs="tcp:152283:108"/>Chriſt, or as believing men. In which believing we meet with
<hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet 1.5. and not beſide it.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of which, is but a motive to draw us to eye
Chriſt, and to fight the good fight of Faith, while we look upon it as the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which the Promiſes appertain, and as men are therein the heirs
of them; and alſo a terror to drive, or curb rather, and bridle to keep in aw
from liſtening to Fleſh and Satan to depart from Chriſt, and from the
Faith, ſeeing that is the way to deprive our ſelves of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: no
room for diffidence here in this way of eying Chriſt, nor yet for
careleſneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as if no need to eye him. The promiſe of
the Spirit runs thus, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments, and I will pray

them, and they ſhall be all <hi>caught up to meet him together in the

Saints, there is no ſuch being caught up into the air there to meet him:
beſides, that thought denieth and deſtroyeth the Humanity of Chriſt and
all its unſpeakable glory upon its

                  </gap>nexpreſſible ſufferings; for
it ſpringeth from <pb n="198" facs="tcp:152283:110"/>ſuch a conceit that there is no
ſpiritual glorified body of Chriſt for him to come in, but onely the
myſtical, his people; and it leadeth to the denial of all that glory that the
Saints ſhall have in their bodies by, and after the reſurrection of them;
yea then we deſtroy the faith, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that even that that is
gone up to heaven from the earth, and is no longer in the world with his
Diſciples, but is contained in heaven, ſhall at the time of the
Reſtitution of all things deſcend from thence and come again, even Chriſt
in that his ſometime dead, but now raiſed and glorified body, to judge the
world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that then they that have here ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
been put to death for righteouſneſs ſake, and for their teſtimony to
Chriſt, ſhall be raiſed up again out of all their death, and be by his
glorious and divine power preſented alive, ſet free from all their
mortality and corruption that now cleaveth to them, and receive the great and
full reward of all that patient waiting upon God, and warring againſt the
Beaſt, the World, Satan, and Sin, which untill then is laid up and reſerved
in heaven for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.13,14,21. Then ſhall it be that they
ſhall have no <hi>more pain, ſorrow, crying, or death,</hi> but ſhall be
<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly like him,</hi> even to Chriſt whom they have honored, and
whom then they ſhall <hi>ſee as he is,</hi> and not onely have glory, but
<hi>appear in glory</hi> to <pb n="199" facs="tcp:152283:110"/>all <hi>with him,</hi> but
not till then, as ſome wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully underſtand or apply the things ſo

warfare, and therein to follow the ſteps of the Fathers who all died in
Faith, not having received the Promiſes: for indeed God hath ſo ordered for
the full performance, harveſt, and full poſſeſſion of theſe great
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that one Saint of Chriſt ſhall not prevent another.
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without us, nor

long ſince are faln aſleep, and as to their bodies are dead, <hi>Heb.</hi>
11.40. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15. Therefore alſo they are groſly erroneous,
and to be avoided as deſtroyers of the faith, who ſay that the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is now made, or is already paſt, and the day of the Lord,
even of that his diſcent from, and coming in the clouds of heaven ſo much

as buſie as ever to pervert thee herein. That the dead ſhall riſe, the
Scriptures are ſo full and plain, and particularly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the
Sadduces by our Saviour himſelf; and the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi>
diſcourſe about it to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that there ſeems to be no
poſſibility of denying it by any that pretend credit to the Scriptures; and
yet ſome ſuch do it by eluding and perverting thoſe Scriptures to other
ſenſes, or other Scriptures that they conceive make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as
others do it upon grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as they conceive, againſt the
Scripture. I ſhall ſay ſomething to either of them. The Scriptures they
pervert are ſuch as that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The body goes to the duſt, and
the ſpirit to God that gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7. which is nothing it all
ſo much as in appearance or ſhew againſt the Reſurrection of the body;
all thoſe that plead for, and believe the Reſurrection of the body,
manimouſly affirming that the body muſt go to the duſt, the ſpirit or
breath be gathered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to God, which is all that the Text ſays; but we
believe too that they that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, even the dead
bodies ſhall ariſe again out of the duſt, and both bodies and ſpirits
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be preſented before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt, to receive the
things done in the body, whether good or evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29.
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.19. <pb n="202" facs="tcp:152283:112"/>2 Cor. 5.10. which that Scripture
hath no ſhew of a denial of; nor that, <hi>that one thing befalleth a man and
a beaſt, as the one dyeth ſo dyeth the other, &amp;c.</hi> Eccleſs. 3.19.
for beſides, that <hi>Solomon</hi> there doth but tell us what he ſaid in
his heart, not what God ſaid to him: we deny not, that as to the bodily
death, men and beaſts are both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto; but we ſay that they are
not alike as to Reſurrection; nor doth <hi>Solomon</hi> either ſpeak of, or
deny the Reſurrection in that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he onely ſpeaking of what befalls
men in the fleſh here, not of what their ſtate ſhall be for ever
hereafter. That which they moſt inſiſt on, is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.50 <hi>That fleſh and blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of heaven, neither
doth corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inherit incorruption,</hi> which they indeavour to wreſt and
abuſe, to the denial and overthrowing the whole buſineſs of his
diſcourſe in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, profeſſedly to prove the Reſurrection of
the body; not conſidering that</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſays not thus, <hi>Neither fleſh nor
blood ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> but fleſh and blood
copulatively together: now fleſh and blood is uſed in Scripture to
ſignifie a natural man in his corruptible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed eſtate; and
ſometimes a body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to weakneſs and infirmity. <hi>Heb.</hi>
2.14. whoſe natural life is in the blood, and ſo nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a
conſtant ſupply of blood from food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <pb n="203" facs="tcp:152283:112"/>from
without; and indeed men ſhall not be ſuch in the Reſurrection, to have
their life in their blood as now, and ſo corruptible and weak. But this we
expreſly finde, that the Body of Chriſt after the Reſurrection by his own
affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was fleſh &amp; bones, though ſpiritualized, <hi>Luke</hi>
24.39. his blood was before ſhed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſins as the
blood of expiation; and ſurely to a raiſed body, and immortalized blood, is
no more eſſential then our hairs are of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a body mortal.
I would ſay rather that as the corruptible body in this ſtate of
corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be and ſubſiſt without hair, or the like excrements; ſo
is it very conceivable that a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized body ſhall ſubſiſt
without blood; its life not being then therein, nor to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a
continual ſupply and courſe thereof, but immediately by the divine Spirit
and Power of God: Therefore its a very inconſequent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſay,
becauſe fleſh and blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, therefore
the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt had no fleſh in it upon its Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, directly
contrary to his own aſſertion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. or that his body in
which was fleſh and bones, was not aſſumed up into heaven; or that mens
bodies which now are fleſh and blood, ſhall not be raiſed, and in their
raiſed ſtate be glorified: or thus; A natural body, while ſuch, ſhall
not inherit the Kingdom of God; <pb n="204" facs="tcp:152283:113"/>therefore this natural
body ſhall not be raiſed, and in its riſing made ſpiritual, and ſo be
a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Kingdom: That ſpeech then doth but point to the condition
of the body when raiſed, that it ſhall not be ſuch as now it is, a body
of infirmity, fleſh and blood; but it denies not that the body ſhall
riſe; even as the foregoing ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the grain of Corn, doth
demonſtrate that he meant; for there he ſays, <hi>Thou ſoweſt not that
body that ſhall be;</hi> and yet we know its the ſame in another form; or
rather that that ſprings up; namely, the blade, and ear, and corn in it
ſprings from that very body or bare grain that was ſown; or that bare grain
that is ſown, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revives again in another and better form; ſo
alſo is the Reſurrection; the ſame dead body that was ſown riſes, yet
not the ſame in regard of its form and manner of being; <hi>Its ſown in
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, its raiſed in incorruption;</hi> the ſame <hi>it</hi> that was
ſown riſes again though in a better manner, more glorious, powerful,
ſpiritual, then when it was ſown.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle plainly expounds himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi>
51, 52, 53. when he ſays, <hi>we ſhall not all ſleep,</hi> (that is,

great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a being changed in our bodies, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them

plain in <pb n="205" facs="tcp:152283:113"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.31. <hi>He ſhall change our

change ſhall not be the creating a new body that is totally diſtinct &amp;

if the Reſurrection was the living again of the Spirit in another body, then
this body that dies ſhould, or might yet lye in the grave, notwithſtanding
that reſurrection in another body; and ſo the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt in which he
died, ſhould have been ſound in the grave ſtill, when the Diſciples
went to the ſepulchre to imbalm him; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly tells us,
that they found it not there, and of that the Angels ſaid, <hi>He is riſen,

immortality,</hi> and <hi>this corruptible muſt put on incorruption;</hi> he
ſaid not that the ſpirit that <pb n="206" facs="tcp:152283:114"/>lives and goes to God,
ſhall appear again in a new body that never was in being before, an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible body made of nothing, or of ſome other materials; but the dead
ſhall riſe incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; yea, <hi>this</hi> mortal, this that now is
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death, <hi>this</hi> very body ſhall put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; and
<hi>this corruptible,</hi> not another that never was corruptible or corrupted
but this body thats now corruptible, that now hath its life in its blood, and
dyes &amp; corrupts, <hi>ſhall put on immortality,</hi> and ſo ſhall
triumph over the grave; <hi>O grave where is thy victory?</hi> which they could
never have ground for, if the conqueſt of the grave ſhould be perpetual,
and never reſtore the dead bodies that it had ſwallowed. So that its clear
by the Apoſtles own words, and by what we read of Chriſt raiſed, to which
ours are to be conformed, that this Scripture alſo is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. As for the
liftings up of their underſtandings otherwiſe, they are partly conceptions
of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of ſuch a thing; as if the bodies were ſo torn and
corrupted, and the aſhes or reliques of them diſperſed, that its
impoſſible it ſhould be raiſed; which is an impious conception, for it
chargeth God with weakneſs and impotency, as if any word was impoſſible
to him; well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did our Lord tax the Sadduces with erring upon theſe
principles, that <hi>they knew not the Scripture, nor the power of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:152283:114"/>Vain Earth-worms! who are we that we will
undertake to meaſure and put bounds to his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, and make that an
impoſſibility with him, that we cannot fathom in our narrow
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions? Of the like nature is that fooliſh conception, that the
world will not afford room enough for ſo many millions of men that ſhould
be raiſed up, as if he that made all things by his Power, when as there was
yet nothing, could not either reduce all the diſperſed parcels of his dead
creatures into one body again, or finde room ſufficient to contain all
thoſe bodies in. Theſe are the ſhallow objections of vain brains, that
think God can do nothing that they cannot reach to in their reaſonings;
againſt which for your defence againſt them, let me ſay but with
<hi>Paul, Why ſhould it ſeem a thing incredible to you, that God ſhould
raiſe the dead?</hi> Acts 26.8.</p>
               <p>Another way in which they lift up their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to
deny this truth, is by inventing, and deviſing how to turn all the Scriptures
that ſpeak of the Reſurrection, to a more ſpiritual ſenſe; namely, to
ſpeak of the Reſurrection of the Spirit with Chriſt; or as they
underſtand from ſome ſad or corrupt frames, to Joy, and Love, and Light,
and I know not what they pleaſe to talk of; whence many of them ſay, they
have here attained the Reſurrection, its now made in his life, and they have
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <pb n="208" facs="tcp:152283:115"/>it all that is to be injoyed. But this
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (as it cannot conſiſt with many places treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the
Reſurrection, as when its ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be a Reſurrection both
of juſt and unjuſt,</hi> Acts 24.15. and thoſe who are affirmed to be
riſen with Chriſt in their ſpirits, are yet minded of a further
Reſurrection, yea, even thoſe who are now dead, while they were putting to
death by their cruel perſecutors, and refuſed deliverance, in expectation
of <hi>a better Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11.45. ſo) the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> hath directly noted in <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> as
an error deſtructive to the Faith of many, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17,18. So that
we cannot without open and manifeſt diſcarding and revolting from the
Doctrine of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us by him, intertain, or imbrace ſuch an
evil conception.</p>
               <p>Preſs on therefore, my Brethren, in minding the Love of God,
in delivering of his Son to Death for our offences, and raiſing him again for
our Juſtification, ſo to experiment his Divine Power and Spirit, quickning
up your ſpirits to him, to hope in, and depend on him, and to live to him, as
that you may therein prove a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him in Reſurrection in Spirit

               <head>Sect. 7. Of Knowing Chriſt after the fleſh, and after the
Spirit.</head>
               <p>I Know they that lie in waite to deceive you, will ſuggeſt
that this that I have ſaid of Chriſt his Death, Reſurrection, and
mediation, is at beſt but a carnal knowledge of him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
fleſh, and not according to the <pb n="220" facs="tcp:152283:121"/>Spirit; and that the
Spirit in evidencing him will witneſs a more divine and ſpiritual
knowledge, and draw off the heart from this fleſhly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or
looking upon him as he was made fleſh, and therein ſuffered and died for
us. To perſwade you to which, they quote that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.
<hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh; yea though we have known
Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth we know him ſo no more;</hi> as if
the Apoſtle meant that he minded him no more as one that was born of a woman,
and died in the fleſh, and was raiſed again, and in that very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
glorified; they had ſometimes ſuch carnal apprehenſions of him, and
looked at him as the Saviour in and by that his death and ſuffering indeed;
but now they have a more ſpiritual al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical knowledge of him. Againſt
which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Apoſtles words, though that might ſuffice to
preſerve us, that I have newly before noted from the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi>
that every ſpirit that confeſſeth not, that is, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies not, nor
ſets not forth Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, is not of God; yet I
ſhall for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction look more fully into that place.</p>
               <p>And firſt it may hence appear evidently, that that is not the
Apoſtles meaning in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, becauſe ſuch an interpretation of
him is croſs to himſelf and his fellow brethren and <pb n="221" facs="tcp:152283:121"/>Apoſtles in other places; for its evident, that both <hi>Paul</hi>
and the reſt preached him as <hi>of the ſeed of David according to the
fleſh, the Son of God, made of a woman, made under the Law, made ſin and a
curſe for us, crucified and raiſed again,</hi> and now mediating for us
with God, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, High-prieſt and Prince of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to
this Doctrine and this Chriſt thus preached and ſet forth, they frequently
exhort believers to take heed, to cleave, adhere, and liſten, and by no means
under what pretext or pretence ſoever to depart therefrom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.
6.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23,24. 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8,9. yea to
hold as execrable and accurſed all that would perſwade them thereto, or
that preach my other Goſpel then that of Chriſt ſo preached by them,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.22,23. in holding faſt to whom, and to the Goſpel of him,
they promiſe ſafety &amp; an abiding happy condition; but in the letting
him, and that go by any means, they pronounce certain danger and unavoydable
deſtruction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. &amp; 10.25,29. yea Chriſt as ſo in the
fleſh abaſed for us and now riſen, aſcended, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating for us at
the right hand of God, they themſelves, and in eſpecial that very Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> rejoyces in, and places the foundation of all his hope and
confidence in, as is plain in that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. as the very thing
which being known, apprehended and received by him, <pb n="222" facs="tcp:152283:122"/>was
the great manifeſtation of Gods Love to him, and the great argument of his
further favor and good will; yea the ſpring of his hope of glory, confidence,
boldneſs, acceſs to God, and renovation into his likeneſs; yea Chriſt
as thus he was abaſed, and is riſen, and mediates for us, being known,
believed, and entertained into the heart, is in the believer the very hope (or
that which ſprings up and nouriſhes in him an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation) of future
glory, as is evident from the fore-quoted place, and that in <hi>Rom.</hi>
5.10. where from the conſideration of Chriſt as delivered to death for us,
while ſinners, and of our being reconciled to him thereby, he infers an
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation much more of ſalvation and glory: So that the knowledge and
mindfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt as made fleſh, and therein dying for us,
riſing and mediating, as in the letter of the Scripture is declared, is not
the knowledge of him after the fleſh, in which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
ſays <hi>they knew him no more;</hi> they that ſay it is, are of the number
of them that underſtand not the Apoſtle there; and in that particular
fulfil the truth of <hi>Peters</hi> ſaying, that in <hi>Pauls</hi> Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(as ſome read it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) ſome things
are hard to be underſtood which ſome pervert to their own
deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the Apoſtle in that paſſage doth no more
deny that he believed that there was <pb n="223" facs="tcp:152283:122"/>ſuch a Chriſt,
and that he had real fleſh, or that he hath now a humane body of fleſh
glorified, then in the phraſe before, where he ſays that <hi>he knew no man
henceforth after the fleſh,</hi> he denies that he belives any man to have a
body of fleſh, or to be naturally a man; nor doth he there more deny that we
are to conſider Chriſt in his abaſement for our ſins, and his glory in
the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, then in the ſaid former expreſſion he denies that we
are to conſider or know any of our brethren in their poverty, ſickneſs,
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, &amp;c. to pitty and help them, becauſe thoſe things
happen to them in and after the fleſh, and not in or from the Spirit, the
phraſe being the ſame for knowing other men as about knowing Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But what then doth the Apoſtle mean?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, to underſtand his meaning, we muſt minde the
drift and ſcope he aims at in the place; which is this: To ſhew their
uprightneſs and faithfulneſs in their miniſtration, which was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the falſe Apoſtles, who by accuſing theirs, inſinuated their own
more ſtrongly into the <hi>Corinthians</hi> affections; to this purpoſe he
had before told them that they preached the Goſpel as in the ſight of God
without mixing or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the falſe Apoſtles did, <hi>Chap.</hi>
2.17. who made a hotch potch of Law and Goſpel together, preaching neither
rightly, while they <pb n="224" facs="tcp:152283:123"/>thought to mix both; he had ſhewed
them the difference between the Law and Goſpel, old Teſtament and new
(rather) <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and their miniſtrations; the excellencie of the
New above the old, whence he ſays, they <hi>uſed great plainneſs and
boldneſs of ſpeech, not putting a vail over their faces as</hi> Moſes
<hi>did,</hi> Chap. 3.12,13. which things could not be truly ſaid, if they
had indeed talked (as its evident they did ſpeak) of a Chriſt in the
fleſh, dead, raiſed, &amp;c. but aimed at, and meant ſome other thing
typified out by it (which we deny they did.) He had told them, that for the
manner of preaching, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. they did it ſimply and plainly,
without craft and diſhoneſty, wit or eloquence of mans wiſdoms framing;
and that by their plain preaching they expoſed themſelves to ſufferings,
not onely from the world, but the falſe Apoſtles too, who gloried in
appearance, in ſeeming zeal and diligence, in and for the Law, and in
fleſhly carnal circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18. that they
reſpected the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, and ſo preached and walked as thoſe
that aimed at the receit of it, knowing the account they were to give to
Chriſt, and the terror of the Lord in that day. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.5 9.10,11.
thence neither did they preach as the falſe Apoſtles to pleaſe the Jews
by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating the Goſpel to them; or by preſſing upon the Gentiles a
neceſſity of Circumciſion, <pb n="225" facs="tcp:152283:123"/>either to make them fit
ſubjects for the Goſpel preaching, or after the Goſpel preaching to

one another know the obligation that lies upon them, and that they might ſee

Magiſtrate, another a Subject, becauſe men are not theſe in or after the
Spirit but in and according to the fleſh; nor would he teach other men in

differences in the fleſh, as if they ſhould put no difference between male
and female, their own wives and others, the Magiſtrates and othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in regard of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Goſpel, and Goſpel-priviledges to 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152283:124"/>there he means that he knew no man after the fleſh,
that is, he minded not, or judged any more or leſs under the Goſpel-right
by their riches, or poverty, wiſdom or folly, in reſpect of natural parts
or education, nobility, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, bleneſs, ſexe, country, nation
&amp;c. or (which will come to the ſame) he knew or minded them not in that
reſpect, as the wiſdom of the fleſh would have led him, but according as
the Spirit of God in the Doctrine of the Goſpel repreſented them,
<hi>viz</hi> as ſinners, and dead in themſelves, all alike, one and other;
and all as under the free grace of God that had given Chriſt to dye for them,
and opened in him a way to life for them, and had given to them (the
Apoſtles) a miniſtry of Reconciliation towards them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon the
ſame Goſpel-terms to admit and receive to favor any of them. And ſo in
applying the Promiſes and Priviledges of the Goſpel, and owning as
brethren, they knew no man according to the fleſh, either according to the
judgement and guidance of the wiſdom of the fleſh in themſelves, or
according to the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differences in them; as if becauſe Jews,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren and heirs of the Promiſes; but the Gentiles, though
believers, yet not heirs or brethren, unleſs, or untill circumciſed; or as
if this Nation, or Sex, or Kindred were more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Chriſt then that,
according to the <pb n="228" facs="tcp:152283:125"/>advantages or greater dignity after the
fleſh. Now it being evident that thats the meaning of the Apoſtle in that
phraſe (according to that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>There is neither Jew nor
Gentile, male, nor female, bond or free, but ye are all one in Chriſt
Jeſus;</hi>) it follows thence, that the other phraſe of knowing Chriſt
after the fleſh, is after the ſame way to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>viz.</hi>
that though they had thought of, or looked upon Chriſt according as the
fleſhly underſtanding or wiſdom preſented him as a mean deſpicable
man, or as more ingaged to the Jews then to the Gentiles for his fleſh ſake
to be readier to ſave them, &amp;c. and though they had minded him, and
judged of him according to what he was after the fleſh, judging of his
Perſon Worth, Office, and work of Saving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g to his fleſh: yet now henceforth
they judged no more of him but as the Spirit repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him and
witneſſed of him, and according as the Goſpel declared and revealed him,
and according to the Spirit or Divine Nature in him; not but that they
conſidered him as dignified or glorified<note n="*" place="bottom">In the
fleſh, and after the fleſh, are two diſtinct things, as is evident in 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. for though we walk in the fleſh, ye we do not war after
the fleſh.</note> in the fleſh or Humane Nature, but they looked not upon
him, as if that dignity he <pb n="229" facs="tcp:152283:125"/>hath ſtands in any fleſhly
priviledge, though they had thought his perſon the more excellent and
honorable, becauſe his fleſh was of the Jews, and he therein circumciſed;
yet now they prized him not according to that, but as the Spirit evidenced him
to be the Word made fleſh, the Son of God which ſuffered, which would have
put the ſame dignity into him as man, of whomſoever he had taken fleſh,
and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that they now eſteemed and valued him, and hoped in,
truſted and believed on him. They that knew him ſo after the fleſh (as
the falſe Apoſtles) they alſo conſidered the kindred and relation in
the fleſh between Chriſt and the Jews, as having his fleſh of them; and
the want of that kindred and relation between him and the Gentiles; and ſo
they thought of him as one that would honor and lift up the Nation of the Jews
for kindred and relation ſake, but leſs advance or honor the Gentile
believers; and therefore that it was needful for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Jews in the
profeſſion of their way of Worſhip and Obſervation; and therefore they
preach'd the Goſpel rather to the Jews as ſuch; and imbraced and applied
the Promiſes rather to them as more intereſted in Chriſt, becauſe of
their affinity in the fleſh; which was the error of the falſe Apoſtles
reproved and ſpoken againſt here by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> beſides
which <pb n="230" facs="tcp:152283:126"/>there is alſo another way of knowing him after
the fleſh; and another effect of ſome mens ſo knowing him: namely, an
eſtimating, valuing, and judging of him according to the fleſh in his
Sufferings, Sacrifice, and mediation; a meaſuring their vertue and excellency
by that, as if but the Sufferings, Sacrifice, and mediation of a meet man; and
ſo of a finite ſorry creature, whence they alſo ſtumble at him, and
count it fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to believe in him. And in this way moſt of thoſe
that turn the Truth of God into a Fable, or the Hiſtory of Chriſt into a
meet Allegory, and depart from the faith of him, do know him, and conſider
him: Yea, and that is the ground of that their denying and turning from him.
What (ſay they) ſhould we truſt and put confidence in a man? Can a man be
able to ſave us? Shall we think, becauſe ſuch a lump of fleſh was put
to death, and ſpilt its blood, therefore we ſhall have foregiveneſs? In
which, and many like ſpeeches they ſpeak like the obſtinate Jews, and
bewray, that according as he is declared in the Hiſtory, they know him after
the fleſh, after the wiſdom and judgement of their fleſh, and not as
glorified by the Spirit to them, and ſo value his perſon, ſufferings, and
mediation as but the ſufferings and mediation of a man; and judging it
fooliſh to truſt in a finite creature, they know him at all no more, nor
will believe <pb n="231" facs="tcp:152283:126"/>in him any longer, or approach to God by
him, or have any thing to do with him, or the ſtory about him, as they call
it, but onely look upon it as a Fable or Parable, at the beſt to repreſent
ſome other thing by, which they call the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> with
the Jews and Phariſees, knew him, and ſtumbled at him in the time of his
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; &amp; its good that men would ceaſe to know him thus any longer,
and know him, even the man Chriſt Jeſus, who was of the ſeed of
<hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, in all his Doctrine, Sufferings, Death,
Reſurrection and Mediation, according to the Spirit, as the Son of God,
though made man; and his Sufferings, Death, and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the
Sufferings, Death, and Reſurrection of ſuch a man as is the Son of God, the
Word made fleſh, the anointed one, the ſanctified and holy one of God; yea
of him that was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with
God: ſo would they not deride him, and faith in him, and them that hold it
faſt; blaſpheming the Tabernacle of God, and them that dwell and worſhip
therein; nor would they ſo backſlide and appoſtatize from him, denying
him that bought them, ſo bringing upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwift diſtruction.
Which that thou maiſt avoid, keep thou cloſe to Chriſt, as declared and
ſet forth in the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles; for the ſame
Apoſtle whom they miſunderſtand and abuſe in his ſaying, that they 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152283:127"/>knew Chriſt no more after the fleſh, writing to the
ſame people in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 15. minds them <hi>of the
Goſpel which he had preached, and which they had received, in which they
ſtood;</hi> and he tells them <hi>thereby they ſhould be ſaved, if they
kept in memory how he had preached it to them; namely how in the firſt
place</hi> (or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> amongſt the
firſt doctrines) he had declared to them, <hi>that Chriſt died for our
ſins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and roſe again
the third day according to the Scriptures;</hi> not according to ſome other
more myſtical way that the Scriptures had not declared: if the teſtimony of
<hi>Paul</hi> be valid, as they ſeem to make it in the other place which they
wreſt to their harm, then liſten to him, explaining himſelf in that
place; and the rather, becauſe he tels us in holding thoſe things faſt
(not according to ſome more ſpiritual underſtanding as is pretended, but
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his preaching and declaration of them) we ſhall be ſaved; to
wit, from running into erroneous conceptions (ſuch as that of the denial of
the Reſurrection there by him faulted) and by conſequence from looſe and
evil practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and which is the iſſue of both from eternally
periſhing; for indeed it is an undeniable truth, that according to the
judgement men make of Chriſt, ſo is their judgement of other things; they
that believe not the firſt fruits of our nature <pb n="233" facs="tcp:152283:127"/>really
to have died, and to be raiſed again, and glorified in the perſon of
Chriſt, they deny the reſurrection of the reſt of the lump or body of
Chriſt, and of mankind in general; and they that deny that, muſt needs deny
the judgement, with its rewards and puniſhments following &amp; then what
will hinder that piece of Epicuriſm, <hi>Let us eat and

die?</hi> for take away the Reſurrection, and the judgement (as we have
ſaid before) and you take away the life of all Religion.</p>
               <p>If then thou ſhouldeſt ever be ſo far corrupted as under
pretence of not knowing Chriſt after the fleſh, to make nothing of, and to
be waved from the Doctrine of Chriſt as in the fleſh, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, and by
the power of the Spirit raiſed again in that his body from the dead, thou art
in the way to fall from all Chriſtian Religion, and into all profaneneſs
and Atheiſm, there being ſo great a connexion between the foundation
Doctrines (as thoſe concerning the perſon of Chriſt and the things
ſuffered by, and done to him of God, are) and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures (as
the things that are to be done to, and in us are) and ſo great a dependency
of theſe latter upon the former, that if the former (the fundamental) be
ſhaken, the latter will ſoon fall; but if the former ſtand firm, the

Chriſt, which is a Law of <hi>Love,</hi> even of Gods Love in him, and thats
a <hi>Royal Law</hi> indeed; for it <hi>giveth</hi> firſt what it
<hi>requires</hi> again of us. It gives power and ſpirit for acting, as well
as puts an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ingagement upon us ſo and ſo to act. The Spirit
writes it, and prompts to <hi>walk</hi> as we <hi>receive,</hi> to <hi>work
out</hi> as he <hi>works in us;</hi> and to yield up our members and powers to
him, that he may write in us, and act forth by us his whole pleaſure, and
confirm us to his minde; and yet we are not to put a fancy upon his writing the
Law in us, as ſome do, that ſtrain their wits to ſhew how God writes all
the Bible over in man, the Books of <hi>Geneſis, Exodus, Leviticus,</hi> and
ſo on, the Creation of the world, of heaven, earth, light, firmament, herbs,
plants, fiſhes, fowls, beaſts, and man himſelf; and ſo of the
Paradiſe, woman, tempter, &amp;c. which yet they cannot ſtrain cleaverly to
their purpoſe in all matters, but are fain to catch at here &amp; there a
picce, as their wits ſerve them, and let the reſt alone: This is to turn
the Truth of God into a fancy, and ſecretly to withdraw the heart from
giving, glory to God in the belief of the Truth of the ſacred ſtory. But
this writing the Law in man, is his framing the heart unto his own 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:152283:130"/>Heart and Will, putting into it heavenly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and
diſpoſitions of love and holineſs, and whatſoever the Law requireth;
<hi>That denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and wordly luſts, we may live godly,
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and righteouſly in this preſent world,</hi> Tit. 2.11,12. nor
yet becauſe God writes thus in man, do they put too much upon man that exhort
to theſe things; for we may the better exhort to them, becauſe men have
principles to act them; no man would exhort a dead man to walk, becauſe he
wants a principle to inable him; but to living men ſuch an exhortation is
agrecable, though it be God that makes themwalk, or that hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipled or
inabled them thereunto; no man would blow upon wood without fire put to it,
thinking by his blowing to make it burn, becauſe there wants a principle; but
when fire is put to it, the blaſt of the Bellows is and may be profitable;
ſo is it here: As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
ſays to the Churches, <hi>I write not theſe things to you becauſe ye know
not the truth, but becauſe ye know it, and that no lye is of the Truth,</hi>
1 Joh. 2.21. So I may ſay, I give the following (with the foregoing)
exhortations to you; not becauſe ye have no ability to diſcern of them, or
principles to lead you to them; but becauſe ye have, becauſe the Spirit, of
God hath begun to write his Law within you.</p>

gifts in and by others, will do all in him: God hath not diſpenced all his
fulneſs to any one member (except the Head) but to all together in union with
the Head, that through each he might ſupply other. Therefore let no one
member ſwell againſt, and deſpiſe other, much leſs God in his
brother; nor let him that is to adminiſter (as particularly that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth)
be negligent therein, as if his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or exhortation could add
nothing to his brother, or as if his brother had no need thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi>
12.8. for God is in and with his divine gifts and adminiſtrations; and as God
in me may make his operations through me profitable to my brother; ſo doth my
brother need that addition of helpfulneſs from God that be tendreth him by
me; both becauſe he is not full of himſelf without me, and therefore cannot
ſay <hi>He hath no need of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.21. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe he
hath a principle in him that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fighteth againſt that of God
that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in himſelf; and that principle ſo ſtrong and ſubtile, and
he ſo apt to yield to it, that he needs anaddition of watchfulneſs and
helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from God through others, as though the fire be apt and fit to
ſet the wood put to it on a flame, yet if there be much moiſture in the
wood to damp the fire, the fire will need help <pb n="240" facs="tcp:152283:132"/>from the
blaſt of the Bellows to ſtrengthen and excite it againſt that moiſture,
or an increaſe of fire to be put to it, that the ſtrength of it multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
may operate more ſtrongly: Saints are not <hi>all Spirit,</hi> though in a

as well as in their <hi>minds;</hi> a law of <hi>ſin</hi> oppoſing
<hi>grace,</hi> as well a law of <hi>grace</hi> oppoſing <hi>ſin.</hi> Now
the law of ſin is more natural to them, and is much excited and ſtirred up
by many outward occaſions, ſollicitations, provocations, examples, threats,
&amp;c. from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; ſo that oſtentimes the Saints liſten to it rather
then to the Law of Grace in them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo an addition of ſpiritual
Grace by, and through the communication of the gifts and meaſure of grace
given to other Saints is needful; that ſpirit in its forces uniting it ſelf
together in the Saints, as well as the fleſh unites its forces together that
it may be able to reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; the charmings of the fleſh
backed with its outward objects, motives, and provocations are often ready to
lull the ſoul aſleep, and make it deaf to the teachings of Grace, and then
the operations in and through a waking Brother may be of uſe by way of
Doctrine, Admonition, Exhortation, and Councel, to awaken it, and make it give
better attention to the whiſperings of Grace within it ſelf; though the
Apoſtle told the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>God wrought in them to will

to incite and ſtir up the heart to liſten and take heed to the Grace of
God, in and with which Gods Power works in the ſoul; that through that heeded

propounding him to you in, and calling you to him by the Goſpel, when

either for defence and ſafety; or for fruitfulneſs, or eternal
ſatisfaction. Rejoyce alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, and count him worthy to

and given himſelf for you,</hi> yea and <hi>waſht you in his blond,</hi>
Gal. 2.20. through the force and power of it, <hi>cleanſing your

Pſal. 149.2. (the Saints in God who hath given them not onely a natural

righteouſneſs or ſalvation of your working; but remember his 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152283:135"/>continually, and his onely; verily ſo much as we take
to our ſelves, and lift up our ſelves, ſo much we detract from, and are
unthankful unto him; no part of his grace is, or was due deſert to any of us;
for then it ſhould not have been grace but debt to us; what ever we have done
thats good, we are beholding to him for it: for he firſt prevented us,
inabled us, and incited us thereunto; and yet what we have ſo done,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not in any way what he hath done for, and to us; you have heard
him: but can you glory in your ſelves for it? his Word prevented you, or
elſe you had not heard; his Word drew forth attention, or elſe it had been
otherwiſe with you; and alas, how much have ye refuſed to hear him in? and
yet what ye have heard from him he hath made effectual to your believing; what
praiſe is due to a Begger from a Prince for hearing him direct him to ſome
large trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? what thanks rather is due to that Prince from ſuch a
begger for ſpeaking ſuch things to him? and how much more for bringing him
to what he by ſpeaking of to him, perſwaded him to look after, and accept
of from him? Our hearing of the Word as it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in us, ſo had
it been never ſo perfect, could be no meriting cauſe of Gods inriching or

the eye is withdrawn from Gods wayes, and eſpyes beauty in ſome other

for the eye as the conſequent of the hearts love, and as a means to bring on,

                  </gap> to give him thy heart, and receive his? what a low
requital is this for Gods heart, that man give up to God his heart? and yet
this is the greateſt man can give, and the greateſt that God requires: And
this is no other thing but what his love and heart diſcovered to us draws
back again from us, and leads us to return: but becauſe He ſees that there
are other ſuiters for it, he is the more watchful over us, and promps us in
that his Grace requires by his written Word too, and calls us to a more wiſt
and earneſt view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or him in all his wayes towards us; and
of all his wayes preſcribed by him for our walking before him. Looking, we
ſay, begets lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and love begets looking again, and ſo there is a
mutual intercourſe of heart and eye, give him thine heart, and then thine eye
will the readilier follow; give him thine eye, and let that obſerve his
Paths, and ſo ſhall thine heart be preſerved chaſt with him too:
Conſider and mind his love <pb n="249" facs="tcp:152283:136"/>to thee in Chriſt in his
gift of him, and coſt he was at there for thee; the way he took to buy and
ſanctifie thee to himſelf; and that will break thy heart, and make thee
willing that he ſhould have it, that gave ſo much of his to thee for it.
Its mens being taken with other beauties, and ſo looking off from his, that
makes them ſlack in their love toward him. <hi>Remember how thou haſt heard
and learnt, and repent, and do thy firſt works,</hi> ſays he therfore to
ſome who had loſt their firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. thats the way to
recover their love again; to call to mind how they have heard and learnt of
him; and if that be the way to recover love when loſt; then ſure its the
way too, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it before it be loſt, that it may not be loſt.</p>
               <p>Cleave then to him and his wayes with full purpoſe of heart,
and take heed that thou never <hi>denieſt him that bought thee:</hi> for that
would be a moſt unloving and ungrateful part of thee: Worſhip none but God
in Chriſt, in whom he hath loved thee, and in the Spirit he hath given thee:
own no other name or object of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, delight, and ſatisfaction. Follow
not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other lovers; and eſpecially if thou wouldſt have thine heart
intire with him, beware of two Corrivals eſpecially that will ſollicite
thee. 1. The world in its objects of profit, honor, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp;c. let

it will deceive thee. And 2. The ſpirit of error preſenting

looked not upon the zealous Jews and Phariſes, oppoſers of the grace of
Chriſt, as their brethren in Chriſt; nor upon the falſe Apoſtles that
perverted the Goſpel of Chriſt, mixing it with the Law, and withdrawing men
from the ſincerity of the Goſpel of Chriſt; much leſs thoſe

Chriſt, who are in danger that way to be worried by them, what ever a mans

Rev. 2.2. ſuch as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the people from him, faulting them that bare

for him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as thoſe that mattered not what men hold or
teach, how deſtructive to Chriſt and Chriſtianity, ſo they would think

his mouth, ſo far is he from allowing and approving them: Yea he tels us he
hates ſuch wayes himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. and ſure he leads his people
to be like him. How canſt thou ſay Chriſt is in thee, when what he
declares himſelf <pb n="262" facs="tcp:152283:143"/>to hate, is patiently tolerated and
not reproved by thee? The Apoſtles not onely bid us hold them as execrable,
and account them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed that preach beſide what they have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or
that introduce another Goſpel, though they come like Angels: but they have

writ earneſtly againſt them, as they have exhorted us to contend
earneſtly with them, <hi>Jude</hi> 3, 11,12,13. And yet thou that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
thy ſelf a Saint, doſt rather bleſs them, and walk with them as
brethren.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, But are we as infallible as the Apoſtles?
can we be ſo ſure what is error as they?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That its true, we have not ſo full a
diſpenſation of Spirit from Chriſt to us as they had that were to lay the
foundation; they had greater work to do, and their talents were proportioned to
their work; but yet through their infallible doctrine, and by the good Spirit
of God given us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. (or elſe we are not Saints, or Chriſts
peculiar people) we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly know the foundamental and
eſſential Truths and Principles of Chriſtian Religion, which none can be
ignorant of, and yet be good Chriſtians. The infallibility and certainty in
Chriſt and his Apoſtles which thou pleadeſt, is an argument againſt
unity with all that thou pleadeſt for; for they having been 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:152283:143"/>infallibly guided, that that is croſs to their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible doctrine, is thereby detected to be falſe and fallible: and thou
canſt not be one with them, and yet not diſlike and ſhun that that is
contrary to them. Sure if we know and love God, we ſhall have ſome
diſcerning and dereſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch doctrines as blaſpheme or
diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor God, and beware of thoſe that bring them: If we be Chriſts
ſheep, we have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of his voice from the voice of
ſtrangers, <hi>John</hi> 10.5. ſo much as may render their voice a
ſtrange voice to us, and ſuch as is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of us. If a man
ſhall come and tell us there was never any ſuch man as Jeſus Chriſt, or
that if there was, he was onely a type and figure of the true Chriſt, in us
and not the very Saviour: that he roſe not, nor aſcended, nor ſhall come
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in glory; that he is not the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us; that our dead
bodies ſhall not ariſe; that the Scriptures are not to be heeded in their
ſayings, and yet we cannot tell whether theſe men ſay truth or not, we
are plainly blinded, and are not ſheep of Chriſt, if we cannot diſcern
theſe voices to be the voices of a ſtranger. Thoſe infallible Writings of
the Prophets and Apoſtles, as they tell us, that there are and ſhall be
falſe Prophets and Antichriſts, VVolves in ſheeps clothing, deniers of
the Lord that bought them, and ſuch as bring in hereſies of deſtruction;
And 2. That ſuch perſons and <pb n="264" facs="tcp:152283:144"/>their Doctrines ought
not to be heeded and liſtened to, but avoided by us, not received to houſe,
or bid God ſpeed, but held as execrable and accurſed, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi>
10,11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 8.9. Yea 3. That ſuch we are to contend againſt with
earneſtneſs, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. reprove them, ſtop their mouths, give
warning of them to others that they may not be ſnared by them. <hi>Tit.</hi>
1.9.11. So they tell us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 4. That real believers have received an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Unction by which to diſcern them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20,27. and ſo have
ability of diſcerning them; and indeed thats intimated too in their precepts
and counſels given us to try and avoid them, which otherwiſe were in vain
if they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our diſcerning. Nay, 5. They have alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably fore
deſcribed them, foretelling us that they would ſay <hi>they are Chriſt,
and deceive many,</hi> Matth. 24.5. that they <hi>deny Jeſus to be the
Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. make a cipher of him, <hi>call him

which God hath begot him, ſo as to diſcern it from other doctrines; that
God hath writ to us by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſo plainly of theſe things, and we

who ſay wrong: ſure we know nothing then, and ſo know not what charity
is, or what love we ſhould walk in, and toward whom, if we know not the
Goſpel in its firſt and bottom doctrines, &amp; cannot diſcern whether
men preach with or beſides that doctrine taught or recorded by the
Apoſtles, when we hear them, ſpeak they never ſo fully for, or againſt
it; we have loſt our eyes ſure and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But muſt we not do to them as we would they
ſhould do to us? though we do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, muſt we not ſtill love
them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, yes, them that are not given over
to deſtraction, them that we ſee not to have ſinned to death, and to have
trampled under foot the Son of God, counting the blond of the Covenant after it
hath been ſanctifying them an unholy or common thing, and have done deſpire
to the Spirit of Grace: which things, as they <pb n="267" facs="tcp:152283:145"/>may be
diſcerned by us, ſo are we to be very wary of raſh and unadviſed
judging. But what love is that that we are to walk in to them that we diſcern
not ſo far gone? is it to hear them blaſpheme, denie, undervalue, and
trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jeſus the Mediator between God and men, and yet own
them as brethren? is it to love them more then Jeſus Chriſts Surely,
<hi>this is love that we keep Gods Commandments; and this is his Commandment,
that as we have heard from the beginning, ſo we ſhould Walk in it,</hi> 2
Joh. 6. This is not love in a man to ſee his neighbour drowning or hanging
himſelf, and not hinder him: or killing and poyſoning others, and yet not
reprove them, or endeavour to preſerve the lives of ſuch as he is harming;
or to know of men committing Inceſt or Adultery, and yet own them as
brethren, and not withdraw from them, and reprove them; much leſs to ſee or
hear them deny or vilifie the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and yet judge them
precious people, and Gods dear children. That Rule, <hi>what thou wouldſt
that men ſhould do unto thee, do thou alſo unto them,</hi> Matt. 7 12. is
not to be applied to men as vitiouſly affected, or diſtempered, but to men
walking orderly and upon well-grounded principles, and ſo in things that tend
to mens good, or elſe we ſhall abuſe it. A Drunkard, or Adulterer would
have others make him drunk, or commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with him: ſhall we abuſe
that wholſom <pb n="268" facs="tcp:152283:146"/>Scripture to warrant his doing ſuch
wicked acts to, or with others? as unreaſonable is it to apply it thus; We
would not be let or hindred in our endeavouring to bring men to Chriſt and
ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore neither ought we to hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in drawing men from
Chriſt to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they think to lead men to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as
well as you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But we know they think amiſs, when we ſee
them go contrary to the word of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: we know their thought but a
ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when we ſee in our cleaving to, and trying them by the
Apoſtolical and Prophetical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they go in the very ſteps of
thoſe that they have forewarned us of. Its true, a frantick man may be, and
often is, as confident of his way as a ſober diſcreet man; but yet a
ſober man will not think himſelf as well bound to be ruled and led by him,
as the frantick man to be ordered by him: both may be alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident as to
the heigth of perſwaſion, but both have not the ſame well groundedneſs
for, nor ability to judge of their confidence. This is no right judgement of
things, to ſay, this is truth as well as that, becauſe I ſee this man as
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this as that man is of that. We are not to judge of truth by our
own or others confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of them but by the verdict of God in the Scriptures.
That Rule, <hi>what I would that another <pb n="269" facs="tcp:152283:146"/>do to me, I
ſhould do the ſame to them,</hi> is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to men in things for
their good, I ſay, and upon well grounded principles; I would that men
ſhould endeavour to preſerve my life, I ſhould therefore do the like to
them. I would in caſe I be deſtracted, have others keep me from hurting my
ſelf or others; I would ſo now in my ſober mind; therefore let me do ſo
to others that are deſtracted; ſo it will hold: but not thus, I in a fit of
diſtraction (ſuppoſe) would have others that are ſober, let me run into
the river and drown my ſelf, therefore I being in a ſober mind ought to let
another that is diſtracted do ſo, and not hinder him: Yet ſuch is their
appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Rule, that would have us not to judge them in an error,
that we know deny the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor reprove them for it, and
endeavour to preſerve others from ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would not have
others judge the Truth to be Error, and reprove us for it, and endeavor to keep
back others from receiving it. Indeed as I would not have others in caſe I
ſhould fall into diſtraction, to do me any real harm, or to deal evilly
with me, to make me worſe, and keep me from returning to a ſober mind; yet
if their witholding me from ſelf-murder or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to others, ſhould
vex and make me worſe, though they therein deal as well and fairly with me as
my deſtraction would permit them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would not be faultworthy: So
we are to <pb n="270" facs="tcp:152283:147"/>deal righteouſly, and lovingly as their
condition may permit, to thoſe that are deceived, &amp; decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and not
by any unjuſt accuſations of them, or violent carriages towards them to
harden and ſtrengthen them from returning, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the zeal
and wrath of men will not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the righteouſneſs of God; onely
ſo far we muſt uſe plainneſs and ſharpneſs towards them as we ſee
neceſſary and requiſite, either for dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their evil, and pulling
them out of it; or however for the preſerving others from being ſnared by
them; and ſo far as that will require it, I am not to matter their
offence-taking, and enmity againſt me for the ſame: love to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
muſt give way to love to the general; and love to evil men, muſt give way
to love to God and good men when they come in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as love to a rotten
member muſt give way to love to the found, and to the whole body. I ſhall
do well if my leg or foot be wounded, to apply healing medicines to it; but if
it putrifie, I muſt apply things to it that will eat out the dead fleſh,
though they will bring ſome ſmart and pain to it that will make it fell and
angry; yea, and rather then my whole body ſhould periſh by its
incorrigibleneſs, I ſhould do well to cut it off and ſever it from the
body before it be too far infected: and I ſuppoſe no man would fault me for
want of love and charity, either to it, or to my body in ſo doing. The like
is to be done <pb n="271" facs="tcp:152283:147"/>to thoſe that being corrupt themſelves
endanger the corrupting others too from the faith of Chriſt; onely by cutting
off, I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean a baniſhing them the Country, or
putting them to death. I would not have Saints in the way of their ſpiritual
warfare, and for their faith, to make uſe of ſuch weapons, God having given
them others to make uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword of the Spirit, Prayers,
Warnings, Admonitions, Reproofs, withdrawings from them, caſting them out of
fellowſhip, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them as accurſed to them; which are Chriſts
ſpiritual weapons, and to be uſed as the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe may require; however ſome
deceived, or not rightly guided ſpirits boggle at it; but as for them when
without, let God there judge them: in the mean while Saints ſhould by all
means out of love to the ſound members, not ceaſe to warn, admoniſh, and
watch over them as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is given them, opening to them the evil of
thoſe falſe wayes, in which others would ſnare them, as we find to have
been the frequent courſe of the Apoſtles in their Writings. I fear men that
rightly underſtand not, will abuſe this thats here ſaid, even as they do
the very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo: yea, not onely they that are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but
even ſome weaker or raſher believers alſo will be too often ready to take
up theſe practiſes which they ought to walk in againſt the Wolves and
Seducers, upon due proof and <pb n="272" facs="tcp:152283:148"/>knowledge that they are
ſuch againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for ſome ſmaller differences; but the
abuſe of truth by ſome muſt not hinder the uſe &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it
in a due way by others. Its likely too, that the Scribes &amp; Phariſes and
Hypocrites of the Jewiſh Church, would be ready to juſtifie their own
practiſes againſt the Apoſtles and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in condemning and
ſpeaking evill of them, by the Apoſtles practiſes and ſo ſharp
writings againſt the falſe Apoſtles and Apoſtates: though in this they
differed, that the one made uſe of carnal weapons upon unjuſt grounds
againſt the truth; and the other of ſpiritual weapons, upon good and
warrantable grounds for the truth; the one fought againſt men with violence
to the death for holding to the Scriptures, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Jeſus is
the Chriſt; and the other ſpake againſt and warned men of the Apoſtates
and perverters of the Goſpel for what they knew they acted and preach'd
againſt the Scriptures and the faith of Chriſt; and probably ſome of the
like ſpirit may think to juſtifie and ſtrengthen themſelves in their
deſired way of perſecuting Goſpel and Scripture aſſertions, by what
is here writ againſt ſuch as lead men from the Scriptures into hereſies
of deſtruction: yet that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be we wary of our own, and one
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others ſouls, and take the Apoſtles counſel in walking towards thoſe
that upon due grounds from the Scripture we ſee would pervert them: 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:152283:148"/>I ſay upon due Scripture-grounds, that we may not
miſtake in our application of the counſels they give us to theſe or
thoſe perſons, left we condemn ſuch as are not condemned by them. Its
needful that we try things and perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receive them, or reject
them; and in this tryal, as its needful to mind the Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi>
notes of diſcerning men, <hi>viz.</hi> to mind whether they confeſs (that
is hold forth, exalt, and lead to faith in) Chriſt come in the fleſh; that
is, as he was made of a woman, made under the Law, died for us, and is riſen
again, &amp;c. and to minde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they hear, hold forth, conſent, and come
up unto the Apoſtles Doctrine, and wholſom Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: So do I approve, that
it be with the joint advice and helpfulneſs of brethren, chiefly ſuch as
are of more ſtability and greater underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not but that weaker
believers, in caſe God by his Providence caſt them upon ſuch alone, in
taking heed to the word of Grace, and looking to God for help, may be able to
diſcern them: but God loveth unity of brethren, and liketh not of mens
deſpiſing the help he therein affords, but puniſheth ſuch
deſpiſings of them and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; to brotherly union God hath
promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his bleſſing, and Chriſt his preſence to his, agreeing
together to act in his Name; a ſheep ſtraying from the fold, and going
alone, is often catcht up, when they that abide with the flock ſuſtain no
harm. To this trial alſo we may give <pb n="274" facs="tcp:152283:149"/>credit to the
teſtimonies of approved under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and faithful brethren, as to matters
of fact, or ſpeech of their own knowledge declared by them; for ſo we find
even the Apoſtles to have practiſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. and 11.18. and
5.1. in believing the teſtimonies of approved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren againſt men, and to
have given warning to others of men whom they proved unfaithful or evil
themſelves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14,15. yea, and it is an argument of ſome
defect and want of charity towards ſuch brethren, not to give due credit to
their teſtimonies and brotherly warnings; ſuch a thing we finde upbraided
in the Diſciples by our Saviour, in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14. <hi>Becauſe they
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not them that had ſeen him after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when it is evident that men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the faith;
ye are to put difference between ſome and others in your carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> hath given dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as towards thoſe
that through temptation, and ſimple heartednedneſs are over-reached and
turned aſide, but as yet not made one with, and confirmed in the deceits by
which men or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath beguiled them; ye are to walk with more tenderneſs
in the ſpirit of meekneſs and love, ſeeking to recover them, till ye
ſee there is no further hope of them. But for others that begin to grow
ſtiff, reprove and rebuke them more ſharply, and by fear, and the terrors 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:152283:149"/>of the Lord, endeavour if poſſible to ſcare them

cannot be ſaid of theſe three, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt.
The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture never ſays, the Father is the Son, or the Father is the holy
Ghoſt, or the holy Ghoſt is the Father, or the Word or Son is the Father,
though God is a Spirit, and Chriſt an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father in regard of us;
yet not the Father of the only begotten Son; nor is the Father the Spirit
ſent by the Father, and yet theſe three are but one and the ſame God. A
great myſterie it is I confeſs, and ſuch as paſſes expreſſion
fully to declare and open; yet a truth it is that the Scriptures many ways
atteſt, both in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Apoſtolical writings: <hi>Moſes</hi>
hints it in ſpeaking of God plurally, and yet joyning that plural word with a
ſingular verb, as when he ſays <hi>Elohim Bara,</hi> the Gods, or the
Mighties; he created Heaven and Earth, &amp;c. And again, <hi>Nahaſhu,</hi>
let us make man in our Image, plural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and yet by and by he changes the
phraſe and ſpeaks in the ſingular number, God (or the Mighties) made man
in his Image: with which <pb n="284" facs="tcp:152283:154"/>agrees divers other phraſes,
as that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

expreſſions of the Trinity, ſce again <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1,2. and 61.1.
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; there is the Lord Jehovah, the Father, and
Me, that is the Word as incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and made fleſh: and the Spirit or holy
Ghoſt put upon Chriſt; which things are yet more clearly opened in the
writings of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and Apoſtles, as is to be ſeen in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. where we have this Trinity diſtinctly named, Chriſt
baptized, the holy Ghoſt deſcending upon <pb n="286" facs="tcp:152283:155"/>him
viſibly in the appearance of a Dove; and the Father ſpeaking out of heaven
and owning him for his beloved Son. Here was more then a threefold denomination
of one perſonal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; the Father and Son here are plainly
diſtinguiſhed; for he ſays not of himſelf I am the beloved Son, but of
Chriſt, this is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, &amp;c. In 2 <hi>John</hi> 3. he is
diſtinguiſhed plainly from him; <hi>Grace and peace from God the</hi>
Father, <hi>and from Jeſus Chriſt the Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> See
the like in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. God, the Father, and Chriſt; as alſo the
diſtinct applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe words, Begetting, and Begotten, Sending,
and being Sent, with divers others, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the ſending forth of Chriſt, as
the begetting him is always attributed to the Father; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent the
Son the Saviour of the world, and God have his only begotten Son; its never
ſaid, nor were it proper to ſay, the Father ſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the Son
ſent himſelf, much leſs that God ſent the Father, or the like; where
there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſending and being ſent, begetting and being
begotten, there is more then differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in denomination; for though the ſame
may be denominated in divers reſpects, Father, and Son, and Husband, and
Maſter, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet its improper to ſay that the Father
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat the Son, ſpeaking but of the ſame in divers reſpects, both Father
and Son; or that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent the Maſter or Son, when he that is all 
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:152283:155"/>theſe in divers reſpects comes himſelf, being
ſent of none other then himſelf. Beſide, its never ſaid the Father was
made fleſh, or the Father ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our ſins, or delivered up
himſelf for our offences; but its often ſaid the <hi>Father made</hi> his
Son an offering for our ſins: God delivered up Chriſt for our offences,
raiſed him, exalted him, &amp;c. which argues plainly that there is more then
a nominal diſtinction between them; as alſo that Chriſt is ſaid not to
have thought it robbery to be equal with God: Now where there is equality,
there is diſtinction too; for its improper to ſay of the ſame
indiſtinct thing, that its equal to its ſelf; yea, Chriſt himſelf
though he ſaith <hi>his Father and he are one,</hi> John 10.30. [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

witneſſes. <hi>I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and my Father

its evident in this, that the word was made fleſh, and ſo is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man
too: <hi>There is one God, and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of God and men, the Man Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. And <hi>God will judge the world by that man whom he
hath appointed,</hi> Acts 17.31. But the Father is never affirmed to be man,
nor could Chriſt be Mediatour of God and man, if not in ſomething
diſtinct from either, as well as in ſomething one with either. And ſo for
the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <pb n="288" facs="tcp:152283:156"/>it is clearly in that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and
the other places of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before mentioned, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from
both Father and Son, and is further proved to be ſo by that of our Saviour,
<hi>John</hi> 14.16,17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend you
another Comforter the Spirit of Truth,</hi> where all the three are again
mentioned, and clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions between each of them from other hinted. I
will pray the Father, there's Father and Son: between whom were there no
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that phraſe were very improper: If the Son be the Father, he
ſhould rather only have ſaid, I will ſend another Comforter, then I will
pray the Father and he ſhall ſend, &amp;c. and there is the Spirit
diſtinct from both, both from him that ſaid he would pray, and him to whom
he would pray; from the Father, for he is to ſend him and is prayed to for
him; from the Son who prays the Father to ſend him, for he expreſly cals
him another Comforter, that is, another from or beſides himſelf that was
then with them. The Spirit of Truth, that is, of the Son, for the Son is the

and by vertue of the ray, and of the Sun; So that if either of them were taken
away and removed from the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, the luſter or illumination in the air
ceaſeth, and they cannot be, but this is and follows too: Here is an unity of
light in a threefold way of ſubſiſtence, by which we may darkly ſee
into the glorious myſterie of Trinity in Unity, which no ſimilitude can
fully illuminate; the Father is as the fountain of the Deity, and to the Son or
Word as the body of the Sun to its beam, not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from each
other, or divided, ſo as the one can be without the other; though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

are otherwiſe interpreted, and clouded out of our ſight; I mean the Father
and the Son, even in a day of temptation, and ſpiritual hiding of himſelf

               <p>But theſe things I bring onely to ſhew that there may be
ſuch a thing evidenced, even to reaſon and ſenſe, as a three-fold way
of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the ſame created being, that ſo we might not
ſtumble at that which the Scripture hints to us ſo abundantly about the
Trinity in the Unity of the divine Being: Concerning which I needed not to have
multiplyed ſo many words, were it not that the old Serpent, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in
the truth, is ſo prevalent in blinding men, and corrupting them from the
unerring Oracles of Divine truth, to liſten rather to the ſhallowneſs of
their own purblind reaſon: For the Saints are not without experience in
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (did they well mind it) of this diſtinction, in the glorious
workings and operations of God in and upon themſelves in their believing:
they prove the Father calling them to himſelf, by the Son, in the power of
his Spirit; they have believed the love of the Father in ſending forth his
Son, and in the word of his Goſpel they have felt his power and Spirit
drawing and inabling them to believe in Chriſt, and to approach by and
through him unto the Father, <pb n="295" facs="tcp:152283:159"/>according to that
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>We both</hi> (that is <hi>Jew</hi> and
<hi>Gentile</hi>) <hi>have acceſs through him</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>by
one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to call upon him, truſt in him, and
have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him. Indeed they that depart from the Son, they both
loſe the operations of his divine Spirit, and fall from the right worſhip
of the Father into Heatheniſm, or ſuch philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical ſpeculations of
God and of his Being, as were found with the ancient Heathens that had not the
light of the Goſpel to inſtruct them; and no marvel then if they fall from,
or deny the myſterie of the Trinity as in the Apoſtolical doctrine is held
forth, with thoſe divine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſhould evidence the truth thereof
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But now to return again to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereto I was exhorting,
<hi>viz.</hi> the doctrine of the Goſpel to be held forth to men, as it
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Being of God, and he but one, though thus diſtinguiſhed;
ſo is it not only the bare affirming him to be but one, or in that Unity ſo
as before to be diſtinguiſhed, that's to be dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but his Name
according to that Unity and diſtinction; the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> how God hath manifeſted
himſelf, and is to be believed in in each of theſe; as that this one God by
his Word and Spirit, having made and created all things for man, and man in his
own <pb n="296" facs="tcp:152283:160"/>Image deſerved and required to be obeyed and
honoured by man; but man ſinning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falling under his
diſpleaſure, and making himſelf thereby unable to pleaſe him, and unfit
for fellowſhip with him by reaſon of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable pollution that
hath overſpread him, God was yet pleaſed in the greatneſs of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and freeneſs of his love to find out a way to recover us again, and a way by
which we might return back again unto him: So as that both his juſtice and
diſpleaſure againſt ſin might clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be demonſtrated, and yet his
goodneſs and love too toward ſinful mankind be magnified; which was by
appointing and ſending forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law,
ſo being found in ſhape as a man, a reall man, to bear in his body the
puniſhment of our ſin, the ſin of the world; and ſo to give himſelf a
ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all. That this his Son, the Word made fleſh (as was long
before, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, fore-prophecied of him) is now
come already, and hath taken upon him in the body that was prepared for him,
the burthen and cauſe of man; and as a publike man given himſelf a
ranſome for All; induring the Death, and undergoing that ſentence of
curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that by the offence of one came upon All men, and
that for All: and hath in grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with that death and ſin overcome them; 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152283:160"/>ſo that God hath raiſed and juſtified him in the
behalf of all; ſo as he may alſo ſee the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatian of all that do
and ſhall believe on him.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that men might in
believing on him, have him for their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Father hath
glorified him in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and behalf of mankind, making him Lord of all, and
his ſalvation to the end of the earth; giving him all fulneſs of Authority
and Power, and filling him with all the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily, even
the fulneſs of Divine Spirit, Power and Vertue; yea alſo appointing and
ordaining him as Mediator to ſtand in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Death and Sacrifice
between God and men as <hi>the propitiation</hi> for them, <hi>even for our
ſins that believe,</hi> and <hi>not ours onely, but alſo of the whole
world,</hi> 1 John. 2.1,2. So as that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, and what he hath
done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſin, he is good and patient, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the
whole world, not withſtanding they ſin; yea, and hath ſent out his
Goſpel to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to them all, without limitation or reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>viz.</hi> that though this his Son there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for them, and he
would have them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to that purpoſe come to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of
the truth: yea He, to wit Chriſt, is He in whom all the world, or any of them
may find favor, and come into favor with God <pb n="298" facs="tcp:152283:161"/>again, ſo
as to be at one with him; namely, by acknowledging his Truth, and believing on
him; who alſo is appointed by his teaching them as a Prophet, by his ruling
them in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and writing his Law in them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing their
enemies as a King and Lawgiver and Judge over them; and by mediating the new
Covenant or Advocating and making interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the great High-Prieſt
to the utmoſt to ſave all them of the ſons of men, that ſee and believe
on him; and ſo judge his and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that that hate his Light, and

again, and raiſe and judge both the one and the other, as they have here

Chriſt, ſo they are to ſubmit unto Chriſt in his Word and Ordinances,
and look unto, and wait therein for this his Spirit upon him, as he that is

               <head>Sect. 7. A Caveat againſt ſome mens prepoſterous
miſtakes about the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation.</head>
               <p>THis then is the brief ſumm of the Doctrine to be held forth
to the world, in which we may hopefully expect and look for the
aſſiſtance and operation of the Spirit to convince them of the good will
of God toward them, and therein of their <hi>ſin for not believing on
him,</hi> Joh. 6.11. that hath done ſo much for them, and is ſo appointed
and fitted of God for ſaving them; And of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> both
that all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs they have of their own is empty, and will not
avail them; otherwiſe no need for Chriſt to have died for them, and alſo
that in him is everlaſting righteouſneſs, worthy to be looked after, and
certain in that their looking to him for it to be met with by them; And of
<hi>Judgement,</hi> that their own ſelf-juſtifications will not ſerve
them, nor their own ſelf-condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo valid as remedileſly to caſt
them; but to his doom they muſt ſtand by whom the Prince of the world is
judged, and they muſt receive their final ſentence from him, who is able,
in caſe of their believing on him, to abſolve them from all
ſelf-condemnings; and in caſe of their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence 
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152283:162"/>againſt him, and the Will of his Father to deſtroy
them, however their own thoughts and other men have hitherto juſtified
them.</p>
               <p>Yea, in this Doctrine we may hopefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the holy Spirit
to draw in, and allure the convinced to hope in him, and believe on him; and
therefore this hold ye forth to them; and to the furtherance of this, let all
your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and walkings be directed, as becoms the children of
ſuch a Father, the members of ſuch a Head as the Lord Jeſus, and as the
Temples of the holy Ghoſt, that they that are apt to ſlight the Word, may
yet be woon to glorifie it by the goodneſs of your converſation.</p>
               <p>And beware, I pray, of that prepoſterous way that ſome run
into, who through miſtake or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the Goſpel delivered to us by the
holy Apoſtles, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, and
through the exerciſe of their own reaſon with the miſtaking of ſome
Scriptures, do hold forth to the world another manner of doctrine, telling them
that ſome few are and were Elected from Eternity, and others the moſt part
of men (even where the Goſpel is ſent too) were from Eternity reprobated,
and muſt inevitably be damned, becauſe God hath ſo appointed to them; and
hath not appointed or ſent forth any Mediator for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him
by; nor that Mediator done any <pb n="302" facs="tcp:152283:163"/>thing for them in his
Death and ſuffering; only thoſe few he hath elected he would have ſaved,
and for them onely Chriſt hath given himſelf a ranſom, and is a Mediator;
all the reſt God hath no good will to, nor hath provided any remedy for, but
hath left them in their fall, that they might there ſink and periſh: thus
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking and prepoſterouſly holding forth thoſe decrees of Election
and Reprobation which they rightly underſtand not, making of them dangerous
and unprofitable doctrines which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in due place and manner
propounded, are very wholſom; for herein they go beſide their
Commiſſion, preaching an uncertain ſound to men which the world can have
no good uſe of; for when they hear it, what uſe have they of it, but to
trouble or harden them? for what other conſequence can they naturally draw
from thence then this? Either I am elected or not; if I be, then I am well
enough, no ſin can, or ſhall hurt me; Chriſt hath wholly taken if off,
and will not ſuffer it to condemn me; no matter whether I hear or not; nay,
though I ſwear and drink, or whore, or do what I pleaſe; if there be any
Chriſt for me, I ſhall and muſt have him, and in due time be brought to
him, and to life by him, do what I can; if otherwiſe, I ſhall but here
torment my ſelf with a melancholy and religious life in vain; what profit is
it to pray to him, and <pb n="303" facs="tcp:152283:163"/>ſeek him, ſeeing if I may
obtain life, I ſhall have it thruſt upon me? yea, and if I be Elect, I
ſhall be made religious too when Gods time is; and till then no evil ſhall
harm me, otherwiſe no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will profit me; Till I be compelled then, and
conſtrained to do otherwiſe, I will take my pleaſure and do what I
pleaſ no actions of mine, can either help or hinder me. Now if it work not
thus with all in the world, yet then they are buſied to know their Election,
which being indeed in Chriſt, cannot rightly be known but in him, nor till
men be in him; and in the mean time the Goſpel is withheld from, or made
doubtful to them by which they ſhould be drawn in to him, and in which they
might ſee good ground for them to believe in him; for how ſhal any know
that there is good news from God for them, while they know not that Chriſt
was ſent of God for their ſakes; or hath given himſelf a ranſom for
them, ſeeing God makes out his Love to men onely through him, in whom and
none elſe there is ſalvation? And how ſhall theſe things be known by
any, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that way of doctrine, but by knowing firſt of all their
Election, though yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel and Scripture-tenor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by the Apoſtles, this is a thing not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent but conſequent to their
being in Chriſt and believing on him? Now what is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:152283:164"/>in Chriſt, but through the hearing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of what
God hath done for them in him, and he ſuffered and done by the appointment of
God for them, and the fulneſs in him, to truſt in him, and through him for
all their future ſaving, the working all their works in them, preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them here, and bringing them to glory hereafter? according to that
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9,10. God hath commended his love to us in this, that while we
were ſinners, yet Chriſt died for us, whence (as follows) ſprings up that
believing exerciſe and reaſoning of the heart for his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaving
them; if while enemies God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us through the death of his Son,
how much more ſhall he not ſave us by his life, we being through what he
hath done reconciled to him? The hearing and belief then of what God hath done
for men in Chriſt is the medium of drawing men in to believe on Chriſt, and
thence faith is called a faith in the bloud of 01 Chriſt, <hi>Rom</hi> 3 25,
but now in that way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinating men, that medium to this believing is made
a conſequent of it; that that ſhould draw them in to him, made to follow
their being in him; and ſo in ſtead of believing through Grace, as the
phraſe is, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. that is, through the good will of God held
forth in the Goſpel, and there made to appear to them, they are required
firſt to believe in Chriſt, that <pb n="305" facs="tcp:152283:164"/>they might be
perſwaded that there is grace and good will with God toward them; they are
required to truſt in his Name, that they may know there is ſomething in it
that they may truſt in, and not firſt taught to know his Name as meet to be
truſted in by them, that ſo they might truſt in it; whereas right
tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in him ſprings from the very power of the Spirit working in the
opening and declaration of his Name unto them, <hi>Pal.</hi> 9.10. And onely
ſuch a faith, a faith of the right ſtamp, a faith that ſprings from, and
worketh by Love, is ſufficient to evidence mens Election; but ſuch a faith
(I ſay) none can have till the goodneſs of God is firſt diſcovered to
them, and they ſee and believe his love to them; for our love to him, and
ſo by conſequent the faith that works by love, ſprings from the
appearance of his love to us, according to that <hi>We love becauſe he loved
us firſt.</hi> That faith is dead which the Word of the Goſpel, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the goodwill of God in Chriſt, and ſo the appearance of his Love therein,
inlivens and quickens not, ſuch a faith can never evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a mans Election;
and yet ſuch a faith they muſt build the thoughts of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon,
that that ſhould produce a living faith in them, being not to be apprehended 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152283:165"/>by them as true for them till that be firſt known,
except they will run themſelves and their hearers upon a groſs
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of producing the fruit before
the tree, the effect before the cauſe, a living faith before they receive
that that ſhould make it living; reſt in the bloud of Chriſt for
remiſſion, before they can tell whether that bloud was ſhed for them,
that in reſting in it, or in God through it, they might have their ſins
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: one of theſe they neceſſarily put men upon; they knowing it to
be unſafe to pry immediatly into the ſecrets of God, and indeavour
<hi>à priori</hi> to find out that their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as a way that leads
to deluſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and yet ſuch an inconvenience many ſo
doctrinated are ready to run upon. Beſides that, while they indeavour to
bring men to apply the Goſpel to themſelves only upon ſome conceived
fruits of Election, they turn preachers of the Law to them in ſtead of the
Goſpel to bring them to ſome ſuch fruits, as legal repentance, ſorrow,
reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and upon ſuch things found in them (as what elſe but fruits
of Law, and a legal conſcience can be produced by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grace and
love of God be held forth to them as teſtified in Chriſt toward them?) they
are bold to apply the Goſpel to <pb n="307" facs="tcp:152283:165"/>them, as if they were
the undoubted ſigns of Election; for ſo much is intimately implyed, by
comparing this their practiſe with their other Aſſertions of the Grace of
God, and Death of Chriſt limited to the Election; from which practiſe of
their legal preaching it comes to paſs that ſome working and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for this and that frame, and attaining to ſome legal qualifications or
workings, with the Phariſee, preſume that they are righteous, and have part
in Chriſt, and bleſs God as if his Grace had wrought thoſe frames in
them, when as his Grace (that is, his love and goodwill in Chriſt) they never
apprehended or believed; nor was that the ground and riſe of thoſe frames
and changes in them, but onely is inferred and concluded to themſelves upon
thoſe frames by them.</p>
               <p>Others ſpend their dayes in ſadneſs, and in labouring, as
the <hi>Iſraelies</hi> under their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſters, to get
to themſelves thoſe frames which onely the belief of Gods Grace would
kindly effect in them, falling ſhort of what they ſeek in themſelves to
build their title to the Goſpel Doctrine of the Death of Chriſt upon, they
pine away in a ſervile ſlavery, and are alwayes neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſperation,
unleſs mercy otherwiſe break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="308" facs="tcp:152283:166"/>forth unto them
ſeaſonably relieve them.</p>
               <p>Take heed therefore of this prepoſterous preaching of Election
and Reprobation to the world, and limiting the Goſpel and death of Chriſt
to the Election which no Scripture doth; and declare that to the world that
Chriſt hath inſtructed us that his ſervants are to declare to them,
<hi>viz.</hi> tell them of the feaſt prepared in Chriſt, forgiveneſs with
him, his death for them; all things ready for their entertainment, God willing
that they be ſaved, and Chriſt perfected for their ſaving; and thereupon
invite all, and call upon them to go to the wedding, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſubmit
unto him. And where it pleaſes God to work ſo powerfully as to prevaile
with ſome, ſo as that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to let go all for him, to
receive him, believe in him, and cleave unto him, we may comfortably mind them
of the doctrine of Election, as the Apoſtles have uſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to
believers, minding them it was Gods goodneſs and free mercy and grace to
them, that they are preſerved, or plucked out from the ſame unbelief &amp;
wickedneſs that is found with others, or not given over for their follies
againſt him; when as many others (perhaps as little or leſs rebellious)
have been more ſeverely dealt with by him; and <pb n="329" facs="tcp:152283:166"/>that in
Chriſt, in whom they believe, they are made compleat; being by Gods order,
from before the foundation of the world, choſen in him to be holy (that is a
peculiar devoted portion for God) and blameleſs in love before him; and when
we ſee men neglect and ſlight the goodneſs of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, we may
tell them how God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſuch and ſuch for their folly againſt him,
and warn them, leſt for the like follies the ſame ſhould befall them; as
<hi>Jer.</hi> 6 30. and 7.4,5. yea when we ſee men reſting in their birth,
works, priviledges, &amp;c. we may well mind men that God hath not choſen the
fleſh and ſeed thereof as ſuch, to inherit with him; not <hi>Adam</hi>
and his ſeed as ſuch, nor <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed as in the
fleſh, nor the Law and its ſeed, but Chriſt and his ſeed or members to
inherit glory with him; the reſt (otherwiſe then as they may be born again,
and become the ſeed of God in Chriſt) are rejected from part and portion in
his kingdom, not from Gods good will toward them, and the death of Chriſt for
them; for that was for ſinners, ungodly, enemies; yea as conſidered in
ſuch an evil condition; but from fellowſhip with God &amp;c inheriting with
Chriſt, which none ſhall partake of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide but in that ſtate of
nature (yea though <pb n="210" facs="tcp:152283:167"/>advantaged by more honourable birth,
or more zealous frame) in which Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his pitty to them in dying
for them; that ſo they may be preſſed to let all go for Chriſt, in whom
there is both ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground for their repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and out of whom there is nothing to be found but periſhing.</p>
               <p>Now if ye do thus, walking anſwerably thereto, not meaſuring
the outward court, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1,2. given to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as if
we appropriated it to our ſelves onely, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping God in his Temple
(in fellowſhip with Chriſt and his people that are in union with him) and
at his Altar (or in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and meditation of Chriſt) labouring both
by word and converſation, to bring up the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their
Gentiliſm and reſting in the outward Court of external profeſſion to
the circumciſion of the Spirit, and worſhip of God in the ſame, in the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and in his Temple and Altar (as before) Then ſhall ye find his
bleſſing upon you, making you a bleſſing to them and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you with
his own ſpiritual bleſſings in grace and peace, till he bring you
ſafely to the full injoyment of the glorious promiſes. Even ſo Amen.</p>

Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.56,57. <hi>He that eats my fleſh, &amp; drinks my
bloud, abides in me, and I in him, &amp;c.</hi> a moſt excellent and choice
dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our preſervation from the errors here in the Treatiſe
mentioned, and from all other that may indanger our miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying: Would we
abide in <pb facs="tcp:152283:168"/>Chriſt, that is, in his faith, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, lowe
(<hi>Iohn</hi> 15.10.) and ſo in the experiment and injoyment of the fruits
and vertues of his mediation for us; and would we have him abide in us (as
ſurely he will if we abide in him) that is, have his love, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and
divine power abide in our ſpirits, making us fruitful, and filling us with
divine and eternal life; and by conſequence would we be preſerved from the
errour of the wicked, and from drawing unto perdition: This is the choice and
moſt ſure and excellent way to eat the fleſh of Chriſt (the fleſh
given by him for the life of the world, (<hi>ver.</hi> 51.) and drink his
bloud, the bloud <pb facs="tcp:152283:168"/>of the covenant ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of
our ſins, that is to mind, view, diligently look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſider, meditate
on, and keep in believing remembrance, the abaſement of the Son of God for
us, his obedience and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the fleſh to the death, the death of
the Croſs for us, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given by him for our ſins; the
victory obtained over death; the pretiouſneſs of the bloud and ſacrifice
of Chriſt; the peace thereby made; redemption obtained; the prevalency of it
with God for us; the covenant and promiſes thereby ſealed; the performance
whereof he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in the vertue of it to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp;c. and verily we
ſhall be <pb facs="tcp:152283:169"/>preſerved, we ſhall prove it the power of God to
ſave us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1,2,3. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>
2.24,25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.6.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Search theſe Scriptures,
and ſee how they fitly explicate the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; live we then by the faith
of Jeſus, and forget we not the ſtripes by which he heals us. But alas, as
many taſte not the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this heavenly Manna, but abide ignorant
of the Croſs of Chriſt, feeding and living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their actings, ſorrows,
good deſires, confuſions, performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, changes, zeal, ſelf-acted and
conceited believing (as indeed I know not how many ſhould do otherwiſe,
becauſe the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God holding forth <pb facs="tcp:152283:169"/>the Death of
Chriſt for all, which ſhould let them ſee good and undeniable ground for
minding it, and feeding upon it, forſaking all other things for it, is by the
guids generally denied and condemned as an error, ſo as they durſt not
believe it: and therefore they having no divine evidence in the Word of God
that Chriſt died for them, they are put upon it to reaſon it out by their
acts and changes fore-mentioned, and to make them the evidences to themſelves
of it, ſo as they muſt needs be the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom matter of their feeding and
conſolation;) ſo many do but taſte it, &amp; abide not there to eat of
it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5. but after they <pb facs="tcp:152283:170"/>have found ſome
ſweetneſs in it, fall a luſting after evil things, counting this heavenly
food but a dry bread; and ſo they either feed upon their paſt acts of
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, their rejoycing, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it in them (which are often
ſoon dried up for want of ſupply from this Fountain, Chriſt crucified) or
elſe they reach after ſome more ſeemingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matter of their
feeding, as is before ſpoken to, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect</hi> 4. and ſo
forget that they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their old ſins, or the means rather of
their purging, the true bread that ſhould have nouriſhed them; and either
turn to the world and their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions again, or are carried <pb facs="tcp:152283:170"/>away with ſome ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their ruine, from which the
eating or feeding upon the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt (thoſe deſpiſed
low things in the eyes of proud men) would have preſerved them.</p>
            <p>Note alſo that when in ſome paſſages, I fault men for
hearing any whom they will; my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not that I would have men tied up to
this or that man, as if it were unlawful to go from any to another, or to hear
any for trial-ſake, or the like; but my meaning is, that men are. faulty in
having an itching ear, that when they have found Truth, yet they will be (out
of <pb facs="tcp:152283:171"/>curioſity or ſelf-confidence) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into, and trying
what good they can get in ſome other doctrines; Such an hearing of them as
our Saviour ſays his ſheep will not afford to ſtrangers from him,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.</p>
